      <title>External isn’t Internal</title>
      <link>http://snook.ca/archives/other/external-isnt-internal</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stupid title, I know. I just wanted to say that when a person or company blogs about an idea or approach or concept, you might think—naturally so—that they’re telling you about something that they’ve personally implemented and have seen great success with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, we share ideas for many reasons. Sometimes we just want the idea to exist in the world. Sometimes we want to document something for posterity. Sometimes we want to talk about our successes and never our failures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this while digging through my archives and coming across where I made reference to the Spotify organizational model. And while we never followed their model while I was at Shopify, we definitely liked the “guild” aspect of the model. And yet, &lt;a href="https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/"&gt;we’re told that Spotify doesn’t use the Spotify model&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which reminds me of when I first started working at Shopify and a bunch of the team got to learn that I rarely used &lt;a href="https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem"&gt;rem units&lt;/a&gt; in my projects, despite having been one of the earliest people to talk about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, what we present to the world is often a very different picture than what the reality is behind the scenes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:snookca@snk.ms"&gt;Reply via email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;</description>

      <title>Unconventional Ways to Measure Project Success</title>
      <link>https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/11/05/measure-project-success/</link>
      <description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Defining project success for a software design consultancy has various dimensions. As a team and organization, it’s important to have both shared and individual definitions of what success means. Let’s look past meeting deadlines and delivering functioning software. Instead, let&amp;#8217;s take a closer look at ways to ensure your time on a project has meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="p1"&gt;Learn about a new industry.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;As design consultants, we often take on projects in industries in which we have little or no experience. An easy success here is understanding the industry enough to help a client become more profitable. Learning about the structure of different organizations, as well as industry-specific laws and best practices, is a more nuanced version of success. As we expand our knowledge, we can pull from previous project experiences and apply similar patterns to new industries. It is also really cool to have your hands in and help influence good design in areas where design may have been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="p1"&gt;Work in a new form factor.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;I don’t know about everyone, but working on responsive web app dashboards can feel a little repetitive (even if they are highly nuanced and custom). But the opportunity to work in a new physical &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_factor_(design)"&gt;form factor&lt;/a&gt; can be a sign of project success (or at least a delight). IoT devices, PC or mobile games, and other infotainment systems are often highly customized products with unique design requirements. They can often be challenging, even frustrating. However, working in an area where you have little &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/09/25/ui-vs-ux-designer/"&gt;UI/UX&lt;/a&gt; experience can help to grow your skillset as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="p1"&gt;Influence ethical practices.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;There are some times in a designer&amp;#8217;s career when they have a project (or feature of a project) that feels a little shady. Being able to stand up, advocate, and be a voice that pushes back against unethical practices can feel incredibly rewarding. And, to be fair, not every unethical product decision is intentionally malicious. But, as designers, we advocate for users first. Address things like “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern"&gt;Dark Patterns&lt;/a&gt;” that stakeholders think are a great idea. This an area where you can stand up and do what is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="p1"&gt;Gather feedback and make continuous improvement.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Working on projects that force us to grow as designers is incredibly important. Gathering &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/04/29/give-good-feedback/"&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; from users through testing, or from stakeholders about misalignment on requirements, or even pushing back as a development team on alternative ways to design a feature — these are all great opportunities to grow in our careers. And, anytime we have opportunities to grow, that is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;What are some unconventional ways you look at whether a project was successful?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrating Alarm Systems with Homekit</title>
      <link>https://carlosbecker.com/posts/homekit-alarms/</link>
      <description>This post documents my journey implementing a Homekit bridge for my Intelbras AMT8000 alarm system.
This particular alarm system can be found in Brazil for a decent price, and is surprisingly easy to install.
The sensors, keyboard, and sirens are all wire-free, which makes it a matter of pairing them with the system and then double-sided taping them whenever you want them.
Configuring it up is not too bad as well: using a shitty app to add all the sensors, setting up partitions, names, users&amp;hellip; The only downside was how shitty the app was, but once I memorized where the things are, it was easy too.</description>

      <title>The Value of Writing About Bugs</title>
      <link>https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/11/03/writing-about-bugs/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My teammates know that I love investigating and fixing bugs. It’s not uncommon that I’ll take a break from whatever task is on my to-do list to spend time thinking about some esoteric bug report. I also find most technical writing to be unbearably boring. But a good bug-fix story has a lot of value and can be very entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to explain why I think developers should be writing more about our most challenging bugs. Admittedly, part of the reason is my selfish desire to read more of them. At the end, I’ll share a few of my favorite stories I’ve read recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Makings of a Good Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned in my high school English class that a good story has exposition, some rising action, a climax, additional falling action, and a resolution. The best bug stories I’ve read follow this pattern too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exposition should provide the reader with context about the system that is experiencing the bug. In the rising action, we learn about the bug, the turmoil that it is causing, and the initial hypotheses. The climax is the eureka moment where our hero (you, the brilliant developer) saves the day by finding the root issue. In the falling action, we read about efforts to resolve the issue. And finally, the resolution wraps everything up and shares the big idea or moral of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the most interesting stories come from seemingly mundane bugs that have unexpected or particularly bizarre resolutions. Other interesting stories come from highly complex systems that break due to weird timing or conversion issues. And more come from interesting investigation techniques rather than the content of the bug itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teach and Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our values at Atomic Object is &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/01/17/atomic-values-teach-and-learn/"&gt;Teach and Learn&lt;/a&gt;. The clear benefit of sharing stories from bug fixing is to help spread the knowledge. It’s a true “diamond in the rough” moment when you’re researching an issue and run across somebody else’s blog or forum post describing the exact scenario. By writing about these experiences, we can help the community by dropping more diamonds into the rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debugging is particularly tricky for many developers. That means learning new techniques from somebody who has climbed that mountain can provide invaluable second-hand experience. I also like using these stories to learn about other team’s architectures and technology choices. It’s often not possible to describe a bug hunt without describing the affected system in some detail. This is a great way to learn about other people’s practices and opinions. There’s also the benefit of reading about new or less common tech. I haven’t often needed to worry about CPU clock cycles in my day-to-day work, but learning how low-level concepts work to follow a bug investigation is very satisfying to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Entertainment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find other developers&amp;#8217; &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/07/10/testing-is-fun-mindset/"&gt;bug investigations to be very entertaining&lt;/a&gt;. Oftentimes these stories read like true crime, with the criminal bug being investigated by an astute detective-developer. Other stories lean toward humor. I find these ironic because I know in my experience the hunt is anything but humorous. I suppose, in hindsight, it’s healthy to be able to laugh at your own circumstances. And, of course, sometimes a bad writer writes a dry investigative report, but even these can push you to think in new ways and find your own entertainment in the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deeper Understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another value I find in writing about bugs is that it forces me to digest and communicate what&amp;#8217;s really going wrong. Sometimes it can be easy to hand-wave over the core issues and jump to the fix. However, when you need to communicate with people who aren’t in the loop, it requires a deeper understanding of the systems. This is a great way to organize your own understanding so that you can communicate clearly with the team in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reader, there is value in being able to be comfortable with incomplete information. An author can’t provide full context, and often these sorts of stories take place in unfamiliar or new paradigms. Being comfortable in these unknown situations while still taking the time to grasp the core concepts is great preparation for scenarios like ramping into a new project or integrating with unfamiliar tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing About Bugs: My Favorites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve found my love for bug stories by reading some great ones. Admittedly, I’ve done a bad job of writing about my own bugs in the past, but I intend to do more of that in the future. I’ve discovered most of my favorite stories shared on Hacker News or Twitter. Here’s a short list of reads I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chronicle of &lt;a href="https://mgba.io/2020/01/25/infinite-loop-holy-grail/"&gt;troubleshooting an issue in a GameBoy Advanced emulator&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the reason the phrase “invalid memory access” makes me think about Hello Kitty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A more recent story that gets into the weeds of an incident that caused an &lt;a href="https://jameshaydon.github.io/nats-fail/"&gt;outage in the UK’s air traffic control systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A story investigating &lt;a href="https://allenpike.com/2018/the-great-bug-hunt"&gt;issues in early XBox prototypes&lt;/a&gt; and unexpected external factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Cracking the Mindfulness Code: Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://www.hostinger.com/blog/mindfulness-practices</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding peaceful moments in the constant buzz of emails, notifications, meetings, and deadlines can be challenging. At Hostinger, we help our employees be more focused and innovative by integrating mindfulness into a daily work routine. Let’s breathe in and dive deep into our mindfulness practices and their benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mindfulness-in-the-tech-industry"&gt;Mindfulness in the Tech Industry&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lauryna Vilutytė, Customer Success (CS) People Partner at Hostinger and an aspiring psychologist, shares that mindfulness is the art of being present in the current moment &lt;strong&gt;without any judgment or distractions.&lt;/strong&gt; She highlights that mindfulness lets you peacefully accept and recognize your ideas, feelings, and physical sensations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s go over the mindfulness benefits in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress management&lt;/strong&gt; – employees who practice mindfulness are more likely to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;deal with stress better, think outside the box, and develop original solutions to challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus &lt;/strong&gt;– it’s human nature to get distracted from what should be our main responsibility. Mindfulness helps us focus and embrace new experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication &lt;/strong&gt;– awareness enables you to actively hear and comprehend your teammates, which is essential for smooth cooperation. Mindfulness promotes a pleasant work atmosphere by helping team members understand and empathize with one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/12/how-to-bring-mindfulness-to-your-companys-leadership" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – mindfulness improves three capacities that are key to successful leadership: resilience, the capacity for collaboration, and the ability to lead in complex conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All these benefits help us foster the unique &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/hostinger-culture-that-fuels-personal-and-global-growth" rel="follow"&gt;Hostinger culture&lt;/a&gt; that fuels personal and global growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gathered-a-mindfulness-community"&gt;Gathered a Mindfulness Community&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have started building a community that practices mindfulness regularly. Hostinger employees worldwide are joining in &lt;strong&gt;live meditation &lt;/strong&gt;sessions online as well as sharing mindfulness tips and insights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mindfulness sessions offer practical tools and techniques to help stay centered and grounded throughout the day. People share that they feel relaxed and more focused after them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/image_50408961-1-scaled.jpg" rel="follow"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lauryna Vilutytė" class="wp-image-5694" height="403" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/image_50408961-1-683x1024.jpg" style="width: 269px; height: 403px;" width="269" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition, we encourage our employees to use the &lt;a href="https://balanceapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Balance App&lt;/a&gt; to cultivate&lt;strong&gt; long-term habits.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a powerful tool designed to help improve sleep, increase focus, and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Moreover, we organize plenty of workshops and give access to videos, audios, courses, and eBooks on stress management and other well-being topics”, she lists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Lauryna Vilutytė shares, she has many plans to improve mindfulness at Hostinger, from creating a toolbox that could be used for a quick mindfulness session before meetings or presentations to including more options, such as live sessions in different languages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-work-and-life"&gt;Balancing Work and Life&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Valentina Cortés Echagüe, Senior Customer Success Specialist at Hostinger, says that mindfulness is &lt;strong&gt;key in her daily life&lt;/strong&gt;. She assures that practicing mindfulness for at least 5 minutes daily can help her enjoy every activity and cope with the challenges that come her way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/IMG-20230520-WA00272-2.jpg" rel="follow"&gt;&lt;img alt="Valentina Cortes Echagüe" class="wp-image-5695" height="389" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/IMG-20230520-WA00272-2.jpg" width="296" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“I believe mindfulness and employees&amp;#8217; well-being are being looked after and cared for at Hostinger. My team leads have helped me balance life, work, college, and sport, as I swim professionally. Hostinger’s meditation meetings have a &lt;strong&gt;positive impact on my work&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I always talk about my personal experience to share this great practice with others. Recently, I have organized an extra meditation session within our team”, explains Valentina Cortés Echagüe. This ownership and a way to develop others is a great example of how &lt;strong&gt;employees themselves can contribute&lt;/strong&gt; to spreading mindfulness within the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She says that the opportunity to arrange work schedules at Hostinger according to the team&amp;#8217;s and customers&amp;#8217; needs is important and beneficial for maintaining the work-life balance. By doing this, she can manage her university, work, and wellness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enhancing-physical-and-emotional-health"&gt;Enhancing Physical and Emotional Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rahma Amrani, Customer Success Team Leader at Hostinger, assures that practicing mindfulness has &lt;strong&gt;enabled her to stay focused &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;composed&lt;/strong&gt;, improving her ability to manage time efficiently and recover effectively from stressful situations. Rahma Amrani started practicing mindfulness for enhancing physical health a couple of years ago when Hostinger provided learning sessions about better posture and ergonomics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/20230430_101140.jpg" rel="follow"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rahma Amrani" class="wp-image-5696" height="391" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/20230430_101140-770x1024.jpg" style="width: 295px; height: 391px;" width="295" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Mindfulness significantly &lt;strong&gt;improved my work-life balance &lt;/strong&gt;through breathing techniques that helped me reduce stress and yoga sessions provided by Hostinger. Additionally, I attended various sessions on self-awareness and learned how to use my traits as &lt;strong&gt;potential strengths&lt;/strong&gt; for time management, communication, and emotional regulation”, she highlights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rahma says that applying the &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/principles" rel="follow"&gt;freedom and responsibility&lt;/a&gt; principle has allowed her to &lt;strong&gt;prioritize her mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt; in stressful or distracting situations and get back on track more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mindfulness-is-a-foundation-pillar"&gt;Mindfulness Is a Foundation Pillar&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lauryna, Valentina, and Rahma agree that the importance of mindfulness in the workplace &lt;strong&gt;couldn’t be clearer.&lt;/strong&gt; They harmoniously advocate for its benefits, underlining how it fosters heightened awareness, reduces stress, and enhances productivity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through the insights shared by our colleagues, it is clear that mindfulness isn&amp;#8217;t a fleeting trend but a &lt;strong&gt;supporting pillar&lt;/strong&gt; of our company culture. It&amp;#8217;s a driving force behind our commitment to the well-being and success of our employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this journey of self-discovery, the consensus is clear – explore the possibilities, experiment with various mindfulness practices, and find the best solution for you. Our colleagues share a list of useful materials for learning more about mindfulness and self-awareness below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boosting Postgres Performance With Prepared Statements and PgBouncer's Transaction Mode</title>
      <link>https://www.timescale.com/blog/boosting-postgres-performance-with-prepared-statements-and-pgbouncers-transaction-mode/</link>
      <description>&lt;img alt="Boosting Postgres Performance With Prepared Statements and PgBouncer&amp;apos;s Transaction Mode" src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2023/11/boosting-postgres-performance-with-prepared-statements-and-pgbouncer-transaction-mode.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement?ref=timescale.com"&gt;prepared statements&lt;/a&gt; in your application is an easy performance gain. Using prepared statements lets your application skip query parsing and analyzing, eliminating a substantial amount of overhead. Pairing this with a connection pooler and transaction mode can dramatically boost your Postgres database performance. Needless to say, we were excited to learn that support for prepared statements in transaction mode was introduced in the &lt;a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/changelog.html?ref=timescale.com#pgbouncer-121x"&gt;1.21 release of PgBouncer&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post we&amp;#x2019;ll cover, at a high level, why you should enable prepared statements in your application. If you&amp;#x2019;re looking for the gory details of the implication, &lt;a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/prepared-statements-in-transaction-mode-for-pgbouncer?ref=timescale.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;our peers over at Crunchy wrote a great post on the 1.21 release here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/connection-pooling-on-timescale-or-why-pgbouncer-rocks/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Connection poolers on our mature cloud platform, Timescale, use PgBouncer &lt;/a&gt;under the hood, supporting prepared statements and transaction pooling. &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?ref=timescale.com"&gt;Start a free trial today to try it out&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x2014;no credit card required!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-prepared-statement-and-why-does-it-boost-postgres%E2%80%99-performance"&gt;What is a prepared statement, and why does it boost Postgres&amp;#x2019; performance?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html?ref=timescale.com#:~:text=A%20prepared%20statement%20is%20a,statement%20is%20planned%20and%20executed"&gt;prepared statement&lt;/a&gt; is a query that can accept parameters that you &lt;code&gt;PREPARE&lt;/code&gt; on the server side, which does the query parsing, analysis, and any rewriting. You can then call this query by &lt;code&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/code&gt;ing it with the corresponding arguments.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to think of prepared statements as similar to functions. You create a template of what will happen in the database and can call that template with parameters to have it happen inside the database. To over-extend the analogy, this &amp;#x201c;template&amp;#x201d; (prepared statements) lets you pre-compile the query, potentially greatly improving the overall execution time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an application setting, many of your queries are probably already templated rather than executing arbitrary queries. These are ideal candidates to use as prepared statements since they repeat the same underlying query but with different values.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="how-to-make-it-work-with-my-app"&gt;How to make it work with my app?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the implementation of prepared statement support in PgBouncer is that &amp;#x201c;PgBouncer tracks protocol-level named prepared statements.&amp;#x201d; Basically, rather than writing raw SQL, we should use the libpq implementation of prepared statements instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for you, whatever language your application is likely using already relies on this as part of the object-relational mapping (ORM) implementation! We just need to use the corresponding API rather than writing &lt;code&gt;PREPARE &amp;#x2026; EXECUTE &amp;#x2026;&lt;/code&gt; in raw SQL ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ActiveRecord, the default ORM of Rails, makes this even simpler for us by using prepared statements by default. In your &lt;code&gt;config/database.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, ensure you have not altered your production environment to turn off &lt;code&gt;prepared_statements&lt;/code&gt;. They will allow up to 1,000 prepared statements by default. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Timescale allows for 100, we recommend reducing the config to equal our &lt;code&gt;max_prepared_statements&lt;/code&gt; (see the next section for more detail). Thus, your config might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-SQL"&gt;production:
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;adapter: postgresql
&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;statement_limit: 100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;prepared_statements: false&lt;/code&gt; is absent, as we want them on (which they are by default).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an example of what is happening under the hood or to use as a template for other ORMs that may not handle this automatically, in the Ruby pg gem, we have the &lt;code&gt;prepare()&lt;/code&gt; function. Creating a prepared statement would look something like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-SQL"&gt;conn = PG.connect(:dbname =&amp;gt; &amp;apos;tsdb&amp;apos;)
conn.prepare(&amp;apos;statement1&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;insert into metrics (created, type_id, value) values ($1::timestamptz, $2::int, $3::float)&amp;apos;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses the same table structure as our &lt;a href="https://docs.timescale.com/tutorials/latest/energy-data/?ref=timescale.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Energy tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the &lt;a href="https://deveiate.org/code/pg/PG/Connection.html?ref=timescale.com#method-i-prepare"&gt;official gem documentation&lt;/a&gt; recommends casting the values to the desired types to avoid type conflicts. These are SQL types, not Ruby types, though, since they are a part of the query.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To execute the query, you&amp;#x2019;d use something like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-SQL"&gt;conn.exec_prepared(&amp;apos;statement1&amp;apos;, [ 2023-05-31 23:59:59.043264+00,13, 1.78 ])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a quirk of the PgBouncer implementation, we do not need to &lt;code&gt;DEALLOCATE&lt;/code&gt; prepared statements. PgBouncer handles this automatically for us.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is, for each connection, try to prepare the statement you want to use once and then call &lt;code&gt;exec_prepared()&lt;/code&gt;as often as the connection stays open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-happening-behind-the-scenes"&gt;What&amp;#x2019;s happening behind the scenes?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, PgBouncer intercepts the creation of the prepared statement and creates a cache of prepared statements for the connection pool. It looks at what the client called it ( &lt;code&gt;statement1&lt;/code&gt; in our example) and sees if it has a prepared statement already on that connection, which looks something like &lt;code&gt;PGBOUNCER_1234&lt;/code&gt;. If it does, then it will just reuse the already created statement. If not, it will automatically handle this and create it on behalf of the client in the database connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implementation lets you effectively cache prepared statements across connections &amp;#x2014;which is insanely cool&amp;#x2014;giving you the full benefit of prepared statements even when using a transaction pool. For example, if your pool size is 20, and you have 100 client connections, each running the same query, this means that, at most, the query will be planned 20 times instead of the standard 100 in previous transaction mode usage. That&amp;#x2019;s pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to be mindful of is the &lt;code&gt;max_prepared_statements&lt;/code&gt; set in your connection pooler. On Timescale, the default is 100. For ideal performance, it&amp;#x2019;s recommended to keep the number of different prepared statements your application uses to be less than this value. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lets you get maximum efficiency of PgBouncer&amp;#x2019;s cache. If you go more than this, it is not a big deal, but it may result in slightly more query plans than otherwise, as prepared statements will get deallocated from the database connection. For example, on Timescale, with your 101st prepared statement, the first prepared statement will be replaced by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-purple"&gt;&lt;div class="kg-callout-emoji"&gt;&amp;#x1f4da;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-callout-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/using-pgbouncer-to-improve-your-postgresql-database-performance/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Need some advice on how to configure PgBouncer correctly&lt;/a&gt;? Here you go!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="final-statements"&gt;Final Statements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepared statements rock! Using them can be a pretty easy performance win for your application while also boosting your Postgres database performance. The only thing to be careful about is to make sure that your application is using the libpq version of creating a prepared statement. Basically, rather than writing the raw SQL yourself, make sure you use your ORM&amp;#x2019;s API to create a prepared statement! Also, in PgBouncer, you don&amp;#x2019;t have to worry about deallocating a prepared statement ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#x2019;d like to try this out yourself, &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?ref=timescale.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Timescale offers a free trial&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x2014;no credit card required!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;co-authored by Vincent Lepot, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ztec6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loic Doubinine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Cédric Conversin, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nH_Zekia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anthony Legros&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*K_2ZLpwH-FJ5IEbJ" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is Forum PHP?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forum PHP conference, which is organised by the AFUP (Association Française des Utilisateurs de PHP — the French association of PHP users) returned for its 23rd edition, and for the second year in a row at Disneyland Paris’ Art of Marvel Hotel on October 11th-12th, 2023! We were looking forward to taking part in the event as a Silver sponsor, with a stand in the hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with the conference, it’s the largest gathering of the French-speaking PHP community. Over the course of the two days, more than 600 people were able to attend around thirty conferences divided into two parallel tracks, and participate in a community evening, sponsor demos, a Lego fresco and our very own music quizzes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our favourite conferences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We won’t summarise the thirty or so talks here as they will be available for replay in a few weeks time on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@afupPHP"&gt;AFUP Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, we’ve put together a small selection of our favourite topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Day 1&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Single Sign-On (SSO) : Simplifiez et sécurisez l’authentification dans vos applications PHP”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“Single Sign-On (SSO): Simplify and secure authentication in your PHP applications”) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Olivier MAIRET, Developer PHP at OpenClassrooms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*44-vu3r-9p8Eg0MK" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Olivier introduced us to the various existing authentication protocols such as Oauth2, OpenId Connect and SAML. The B2B development of OpenClassrooms required the implementation of an authentication protocol, and the choice fell on SAML 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its ease of configuration with three popular extensions available and its security through data encryption from the very first exchange enabled them to meet the initial requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“ReactPhp, Amp, RevoltPhp: comparatif des frameworks asynchrones” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“ReactPhp, Amp, RevoltPhp: comparing asynchronous frameworks”)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Benoit VIGUIER, Senior Developer at Lendable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benoit presented us with a comparison of the three most popular asynchronous PHP frameworks: ReactPhp, Amp and RevoltPhp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the different syntaxes and behaviours — with the use or not of Fibers — and the state of the community behind these three solutions, Benoit gave us a concrete example with the use of several simultaneous HTTP calls. Finally, he explained to us why he would prefer one or another solution if he were to start implementing asynchronous services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0Kdlcwa1Sxfak5Zu" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Example: Amp syntax&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_WH77QHX4bbL4Qmn" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Example: Revolt syntax&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“J’ai créé un service SaaS, voyons ce qu’il ne faut pas faire”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“I created a SaaS service, and here is what you shouldn’t do”)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Gregory Planchat, CTO at Gyroscops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk was an experience feedback on the migration of a service to the Cloud. Grégory went through a lot of steps and errors that led him to define a set of principles for anyone who would like to migrate to the Cloud (some of these guidelines are valid even for non-cloud-based projects):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding a new technology in a project is very impactful, even on a non-technical level: consider the human and financial cost when doing your technology watch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A choice of technology is very structuring. It’s very complicated to revert to another solution afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t adopt technologies because they are fancy and trendy for you would expose yourself to the risk of jeopardising your project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the toil of your workflow (such as the deployment step) by creating your own tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the human aspect plays a key part in the success of your project, you must support your teams in the adoption of the new technology:&lt;br /&gt; - Create a proper onboarding. Grégory mentioned that pair programming is the best method to spread knowledge and best practices.&lt;br /&gt; - Create a solid set of documentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the observability of your code (no silent exception catch).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only adopt tools that you really need for some of them are overkill.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain your technical choices in specific documents called ADRs (Architectural Decision Records), and have them read and challenged by your teams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time is the sinews of war! Only concentrate on essential things. To succeed in developing a new project, you should follow the order below:&lt;br /&gt; - Focus on your POC,&lt;br /&gt; - Once the POC is done, focus on your MVP,&lt;br /&gt; - Once the MVP is stabilised, focus on your MSP (Minimum Sellable Product).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Les journalistes se moquent des logiciels libres, je vous explique pourquoi”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“Journalists do not care about free softwares, I’ll explain why”) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;by Loris GUÉMART, Journalist at Arrêt sur images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x5YslPB5AW8mxNWt" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To finish the first day of talks, we attended a single track with an honoured guest: a journalist from the “Arrêt sur images” media. Loris Guémart and “Arrêt sur images” usually analyse the media coverage of various topics. He made no exception there and explained why journalists don’t care at all about free softwares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loris started by doing a global press review to insist on the fact that there is absolutely no coverage of the Forum PHP 2023, or any previous edition for that matter. He continued by doing the same for free software in general to eventually state the obvious (at least, after reading the title of the talk): no one writes about free software and the few exceptions are not really the best examples. Even in the specialised press, only a small part is about free software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, Loris &lt;em&gt;simply&lt;/em&gt; explained that journalists are just people like anybody else. We all live in the same world and free software is not the norm today. We would like it to be the opposite, but it is not. He specifically talked about his own situation, as an advocate of free software. He and his journal want to promote free software, but not all journalists want to talk about it or even agree on the importance of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we, tech people, change that? Or at least, how can we try to influence journalists to write about free software? After trolling about giving journalists a free helicopter ride to the Forum PHP so they cover the event, and taking the example of Cochonou at &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; Tour de France, he talked about the more interesting topics that are tackled in such conferences. He specifically mentioned the journalistic interest of talks like “Femmes et numérique : enjeux et solutions” (&lt;em&gt;“Women and digital technology: issues and solutions”&lt;/em&gt;), or “Burn-out dans l’IT, le commencement” (&lt;em&gt;“Burnouts in IT, the beginning”&lt;/em&gt;), “Équilibre pro/perso : expérimentations autour du temps de travail et de la rémunération” (&lt;em&gt;“Professional-personal balance: experimenting with working time and salaries”&lt;/em&gt;). All of them were scheduled at the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea would be to include more engaging topics for journalists, and for anyone basically. This would indirectly shed some light on the rest. With more and more coverage, trends may change over time. Of course, there is no magical solution — except maybe the helicopter ride, but that may not be very cost effective, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk was part of the “outside the box” selection, which is refreshing to attend. It allows you to go beyond your technical stacks and discussions, and closing the day with such topics is a great idea to start new conversations between attendees. Kudos to the organisation for that ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Day 2&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Changements de comportements en PHP 8”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“Changes of behaviours in PHP 8”)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Damien SEGUY, CTO at Exakat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*UZzTv_naV0uoebYs" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damien didn’t talk much about elephants although they did accompany him on stage to help him present the subject. PHP 8 induced many behavioural changes to the PHP language that have not always been indicated in the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to multiple examples on array sorting and string/integer comparisons, we will retain from his conclusion that it is important to run unit tests on future versions to detect and anticipate any changes, use universal notations, equip yourself with a static code analyzer, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Index Wars : Le pouvoir des Jedi des Index dans l’univers de Postgres”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“Index Wars: The power of Index Jedis in the Postgres universe”) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;by Laeticia AVROT, Field CTO at EDB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PrKFs6WJ4Bt7ZjJu" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laeticia successfully deep-dived into the vast topic of indexes in Postgres. Starting with a relatively succinct but complete introduction about what an index is and how it is used, she then delved into more complex subjects. We’ve learned about a multitude of new different approaches to customising and optimising our future indexes. Laeticia provided us with a broad overview of what can be done and gave us all the keys to explore further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You Build It, You Run it, l’observabilité pour les devs”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“You Build It, You Run it, observability for devs”) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;by Smaine MILIANNI, Freelance Senior Developer at Yousign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a passionate developer, Smaine detailed what is observability, its three pillars (metrics, logs, traces), and why a team dedicated to the developer experience can be really useful in a company in order to improve velocity and quality. A development is not finished once the code is pushed to production. You also need to know whether it works well… and when and why it does not. A very useful talk if you are not already aware of the benefits of observability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“La mutabilité m’a tué, l’immutabilité m’a sauvé”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“Mutability killed me, immutability saved me”)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Sadetin Eyili, Senior PHP Engineer at Ekino&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his first public talk, Sadetin chose the topic of immutability. He explained how a mutable object (namely a DateTime) in his code had numerous side effects: a change to one object had an effect on another, which at first made him confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He understood his error and went on to clone all objects when immutability was needed… until he realised that this method degraded the DX by overloading the code with cumbersome cloning everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he discovered the ImmutableDateTimeObject, and the concept of immutability, and found ways to implement it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the new PHP 8 “readonly” feature (even if it does not guarantee immutability, it helps),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“wither” accessors to replace setters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, when coding, you should start with the idea that your objects are immutable, and then set them as mutable only when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Open/Closed principle : on a dit étendre, pas extends !”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“Open/Closed principle: we said extend, not extends!”)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;by Thomas Dutrion, CTO at Echos Annonces &amp;amp; Freelance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas started with the SOLID principles and focused on the Open/Closed principle. Historically, it was implemented in OO by inheritance but it had an impact on both the single responsibility and encapsulation principles, not to mention it can also lead to a complex inheritance tree when your needs get bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas then praised the composition mechanism over inheritance. Composition has the advantage of being more readable, and it respects the SRP and the encapsulation principle. He introduced some design patterns such as the Decorator, the Observer, and callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, he pinpointed that the use of “switch” and “match” operators are often the signs of a closed code, and promoted the use of collections of handlers instead, which is eased by the usage of a dependency injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Femmes et numérique : enjeux et solutions”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“Women and digital technology: issues and solutions”)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;by Isabelle COLLET, Educational Science professor at the University of Geneva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very interesting talk (as often the case with non-technical talks at Forum PHP) about the place of women in the digital world. Historically, women were much more present in technological companies. But at some point, in the early 80s, their number decreased. Isabelle Collet summarised the research studies that explain why the situation changed, and gave us clues about what can be done to restore parity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beyond conferences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;On the Deezer stand&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/1*YcuAdPqprdsxGH0EQ47kgg.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Deezer team on the Deezer stand&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We chose to support the community as a Silver Sponsor with a stand for the second year in a row. It was an opportunity for us to talk to participants about the PHP ecosystem and to follow the conferences. We also hosted four multiplayer music quizzes each day to liven things up in the conference hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussions with visitors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The two days were packed with encounters with conference attendees, many of whom wondered what role PHP plays in the Deezer tech ecosystem. We also discussed some aspects of the product such as Flow and music quizzes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music quiz sessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*d3GNlKoDJbZunG2v" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A music quiz at the Deezer stand&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started preparing goodies and music quizzes several months before the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants put their music knowledge to the test on themed playlists like Disney, video games, elephants, anime, etc. Attendees were quite shy on the first day but the few people who dared to join us for a quiz very much appreciated the experience. We were happy to welcome more people on the second day, with more than 15 players per session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massive thanks to our colleague Pierre Bertrand, who knitted elephant key rings especially for the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*m8BqBZqZ42PUfqSo" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pierre Bertrand, creator of knitted elephants&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;AFUP&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community evening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The theme of this year’s community evening was a badge-scanning game that consisted in finding all the members of your assigned team. It was a chance for people to take a step towards each other in the Marvel Hotel, and even in Disney Village, where the whole community gathered to toast new encounters and reunions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winners of the game were the “Axolotl” team — were you one of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative Lego fresco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tBFgayknuJe-mtQl" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, AFUP offered a collaborative Lego fresco activity. After the local branches theme last year, this year’s theme was SUPHPERHERO. It took visitors two half days to complete the fresco, piece by piece during breaks. We participated and loved it. What about you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nGkOh7WyT6qSvpo7" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a top AFUP event for the French-speaking PHP community! A huge thanks to the organisers, speakers, sponsors and visitors for these two magical days at Disneyland Paris’ Art of Marvel Hotel. We were delighted to chat with all of you on the Deezer stand, and to share some suspenseful music quizzes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See you in 2024 for the next edition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=791706cd0fa9" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://deezer.io/back-from-forum-php-2023-791706cd0fa9"&gt;Back from Forum PHP 2023&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://deezer.io"&gt;Deezer I/O&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake Weber是一位多领域设计师、工程师和作家，他创造了Printernet项目，将在线内容打印成有形书籍。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake在2021年看到了关于Replit的一篇文章后深受启发，他被Replit的易用性吸引住了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake在长途驾车回奥斯汀的路上反思了自己在线阅读的量，意识到与阅读纸质书籍相比，从屏幕上阅读的体验相形见绌，于是他构思了Printernet的想法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake利用Replit开始构建Printernet，以减少手动编译和格式化每期刊物所需的时间，并逐渐将Printernet迁移到Replit平台上进行下一版本的开发。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake通过使用Replit AI和Deployments来扩展Printernet的自动化流程，包括账户管理、内容整理和在家进行格式化和打印等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作为一名自学的开发者和设计师，Jake首先构建前端界面，然后利用Replit AI帮助他使用Python构建后端。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在短短几个月内，Jake在Replit上独立开发了Chrome扩展、账户管理、支付处理、自动格式化和社交功能等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;借助这些自动化流程，Printernet现在已准备好扩大规模，吸引更广泛的用户群体。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake Weber是一位多领域设计师、工程师和作家，他创建了Printernet项目，旨在将在线内容以有形书籍的形式呈现。他利用Replit平台进行自动化流程的开发，从而提高了产品的效率。他通过使用Replit AI和Deployments来扩展Printernet的功能，并成功构建了一个完整的用户体验。通过Printernet，用户可以定制自己的刊物并进行自动格式化和打印。这种自动化的流程使得Printernet能够规模化，并吸引更广泛的用户群体。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jake Weber is a multidisciplinary designer, engineer, and writer who has always been drawn to invention as a kind of balance between art and real-world impact. It’s no surprise then that Jake built Printernet, a project that bridges our online lives with tactile experience by “packaging up your bookmarked articles to be read by you, in your hands, in a carefully bound print edition.”     Jake’s journey with Replit began in 2021 when he saw a Paul Graham post referencing Replit. Immediately, he was hooked by how easy it was to get up and running quickly.   Shortly after, on a long drive back to Austin, Jake reflected on how much reading he was doing online and how the experience of reading off a screen paled compared to picking up and diving into a physical book. What he needed to build was a physical RSS feed. That’s when the idea of Printernet was born.     Inspired by an interview with Michael Seibel about launching fast with an MVP, Jake started building Printernet in earnest. Jake first hosted Printernet on Squarespace and started printing the issues himself. Eventually, Product Hunt  caught wind of the project, indicating that Jake wasn’t the only one who wanted a physical RSS feed. Today, Jake is building the next version of Printernet on Replit.   Jake started integrating Replit into Printernet to build automations to cut down on the time it took to manually compile and format each issue. “I was literally copying and pasting text from websites, one at a time. This process was extremely tedious and probably took 2 to 3 days to fulfill a single order. Once I began developing automations with Replit the time it took to fulfill an order went down dramatically. Now, with my Replit code, the moment an order is placed my Python Repl begins working for me.”   He’s been extending those automations with the help of Replit AI and Deployments to help scale up the Printernet experience, working on account management, content curation, and even an at-home formatting and printing experience. “As I’ve been working on the Printernet web app, Replit has provided similar gains in efficiency. I got some of the key features up and running within a week. Things like Replit AI, the ease of installing packages, and the effortless deployment feature have been delightful. These things let me focus on the creative fun stuff and execute on my ideas insanely fast.”     As a self-taught developer and designer, Jake starts by building the frontend. Once he has pixels on the screen, Jake uses Replit AI to help him build the back end in Python. “I’d never written a line of Python in my life and after a few working sessions reduced the time it took to fulfill orders by orders of magnitude. Replit’s AI was crucial during this…When it first worked it was magical.”   &gt; “I’ll usually go to Replit AI because then I’m staying in the site, staying in the flow…I never leave”   In just a few months, Jake has built out a Chrome extension, account management, and payment processing, automatic formatting, and even social features, all on his own and all on Replit. “Now there are API endpoints for this Repl (using node.js with Replit) and when users order an issue their five reading selections are sent into the Repl directly, which starts working on them right away. It cleans them up (removing ads, images, comments, social links, and other distracting stuff), adds the Printernet style to them, and also does cool stuff like save any links present in the reading material to distinct link files.”   Thanks to these automations, Printernet is now ready to scale up and welcome a wider audience. Become an early adopter, build your own Printernet issue!   Follow Jake’s journey and add him to your reading list.</description>

      <title>Using Redis Modules For Advanced Use-Cases</title>
      <link>https://semaphoreci.com/blog/redis-modules</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://redis.io/"&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an open-source, in-memory datastore with powerful native data structures. There are, however, use cases where you might need additional features or completely different capabilities altogether. Redis modules are advanced features that allow us to implement custom data types specific. Essentially, a module is a dynamic library that can be loaded into Redis at startup or on demand with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MODULE LOAD&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;command. Modules can be written in various languages including C and Rust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Implementing a new data type by ourselves with Redis modules is a nontrivial effort. Thankfully, there are many popular and widely used modules to solve problems such as full-text search (RediSearch), time series processing (RedisTimeSeries), and native JSON support (RedisJSON). Let’s get an overview of some of the more widely used Redis modules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-overview-of-popular-redis-modules"&gt;Overview of popular Redis Modules&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This section provides a high-level overview of RediSearch, RedisJSON and RedisTimeSeries modules, along with the important commands associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redisjson"&gt;RedisJSON&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to handling JSON data in Redis, traditional approaches have their limitations. Redis, by default, treats values as simple strings, lacking built-in support for querying or manipulating structured data like JSON. As a result, developers often resort to storing JSON as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;stringified&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;values, sacrificing the ability to perform efficient operations on individual fields or take advantage of nested structures. This approach requires parsing the entire JSON document even for minor updates, resulting in inefficiency and increased processing overhead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RedisJSON module addresses these challenges by introducing native JSON handling capabilities to Redis. It lets you store, update, and retrieve JSON like any other native data type.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RedisJSON offers a rich set of operations on JSON documents. Here are some of the most commonly used commands:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.SET&lt;/code&gt;: Sets a JSON value in Redis.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.GET&lt;/code&gt;: Retrieves JSON values associated with a given key.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.DEL&lt;/code&gt;: Deletes a JSON value from Redis.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.TYPE&lt;/code&gt;: Returns the type of a JSON value, indicating whether it is an object, array, string, number, boolean, or null.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.ARRAPPEND&lt;/code&gt;: Appends one or more values to the end of a JSON array.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.ARRLEN&lt;/code&gt;: Returns the length of a JSON array, providing the number of elements it contains.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.OBJKEYS&lt;/code&gt;: Retrieves the keys of a JSON object, returning an array of all the keys present.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.OBJLEN&lt;/code&gt;: Returns the size of JSON object.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.NUMINCRBY&lt;/code&gt;: Increments a numeric value within a JSON document by a specified amount.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.STRAPPEND&lt;/code&gt;: Appends a strings within a JSON document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redisearch"&gt;RediSearch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RediSearch module enhances Redis with powerful full-text search capabilities. It introduces an inverted index-based search engine, allowing efficient and scalable text search. With RediSearch, you can index textual data, perform complex search queries, and retrieve relevant search results. It provides features like keyword search, exact phrase matching, boolean operations, pagination, sorting, and filtering. RediSearch scores search results based on how well they match the query, enabling you to rank and prioritize search results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the most commonly used RediSearch commands:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FT.CREATE&lt;/code&gt;: Creates a new search index with specified schema and configuration options.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FT.SEARCH&lt;/code&gt;: Performs a search query on the specified index, returning matching documents based on the given search criteria.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FT.AGGREGATE&lt;/code&gt;: Performs an aggregation query on the specified index, returning aggregated results based on the given aggregation criteria.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FT.INFO&lt;/code&gt;: Retrieves information about a search index, including statistics, configuration settings, and schema details.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FT.DROPINDEX&lt;/code&gt;: Deletes a search index, removing all the documents and associated data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redistimeseries"&gt;RedisTimeSeries&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to handling high-volume time series data in Redis, there are a few techniques commonly used. These involve storing data in Redis Sorted Sets, where the score represents the timestamp, and the member represents the data value. Another approach is to use string keys with a timestamp as part of the key name. Each key-value pair represents a specific data point in the time series.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these techniques have some limitations when dealing with high-volume time series data. Traditional Redis data structures like String keys or Sorted Sets have limited querying capabilities, and it&amp;#8217;s difficult to perform complex aggregations. Also, storing each data point as a separate key-value pair can consume a significant amount of memory when dealing with large datasets, which is often the case with time series.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RedisTimeSeries module is a native time series data structure that provides efficient storage and querying capabilities for time series data. It adds querying capabilities such as retrieving data within a time range, performing aggregations (e.g., sum, count, average), down sampling, and interpolation. It also allows us to define retention policies that automatically expire or downsample data, enabling efficient data retention and reducing storage requirements. RedisTimeSeries also integrates with other tools in the ecosystem such as Prometheus and Grafana.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RedisTimeSeries offers a rich set of commands. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.CREATE&lt;/code&gt;: Creates a new time series with the specified key, labels, and retention policy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.ADD&lt;/code&gt;: Adds a new data point to a time series, associating it with a timestamp and value.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.RANGE&lt;/code&gt;: Retrieves a range of data points from a time series within a specified time range.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.MRANGE&lt;/code&gt;: Retrieves data points from multiple time series within a specified time range.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.GET&lt;/code&gt;: Retrieves the latest data point from a time series.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.MGET&lt;/code&gt;: Retrieves the latest data points from multiple time series.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.INCRBY&lt;/code&gt;: Increments the value of a data point in a time series at a specific timestamp.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.DECRBY&lt;/code&gt;: Decrements the value of a data point in a time series at a specific timestamp.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.INFO&lt;/code&gt;: Retrieves metadata information about a time series, such as the number of samples, memory usage, and retention policy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS.QUERYINDEX&lt;/code&gt;: Performs an index-based query on a time series, retrieving data points based on specified filters and aggregations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a basic understanding of these Modules, let&amp;#8217;s learn how to use them in practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-using-redis-modules"&gt;Using Redis modules&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To follow this part of the tutorial you will need to &lt;a href="https://go.dev/dl/"&gt;install a recent version of Go&lt;/a&gt; and Docker. All the aforementioned modules are available as part of &lt;a href="https://redis.io/docs/stack/about/"&gt;Redis Stack&lt;/a&gt;, which bundles Redis with various related packages and services. You can start a Redis Stack &lt;a href="https://redis.io/docs/stack/get-started/install/"&gt;local instance&lt;/a&gt; using Docker:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" lang="bash"&gt;docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack:latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before starting, let&amp;#8217;s create a Go module to host the examples:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" lang="bash"&gt;go mod init go-redis-modules&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redisjson-1"&gt;RedisJSON&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The below example demonstrates how to use various RedisJSON commands in a Go application. Note that we are using the &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/redis/go-redis"&gt;go-redis&lt;/a&gt; client.&lt;ins&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-go" lang="go"&gt;package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/redis/go-redis/v9"
)

func main() {
	rdb := redis.NewClient(&amp;amp;redis.Options{
		Addr: "localhost:6379",
	})

	ctx := context.Background()

	// JSON.SET
	err := rdb.Do(ctx, "JSON.SET", "mydoc", ".", `{"name":"John","credits":30,"cars":["honda","toyota"]}`).Err()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// JSON.GET
	val, err := rdb.Do(ctx, "JSON.GET", "mydoc").Result()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("JSON.GET result -", val)

	// JSON.ARRAPPEND
	_, err = rdb.Do(ctx, "JSON.ARRAPPEND", "mydoc", ".cars", `"audi"`).Int()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("added audi to list of cars using JSON.ARRAPPEND")

	// JSON.GET
	val, err = rdb.Do(ctx, "JSON.GET", "mydoc").Result()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("lastest document", val)

	// JSON.NUMINCRBY
	_, err = rdb.Do(ctx, "JSON.NUMINCRBY", "mydoc", ".credits", 5).Result()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("incremented credits by 5 using JSON.NUMINCRBY")

	// JSON.STRAPPEND
	_, err = rdb.Do(ctx, "JSON.STRAPPEND", "mydoc", ".name", `", Jr."`).Int()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("updated name using JSON.STRAPPEND")

	// JSON.GET
	val, err = rdb.Do(ctx, "JSON.GET", "mydoc").Result()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("latest document", val)

	// JSON.DEL
	_, err = rdb.Do(ctx, "JSON.DEL", "mydoc").Int()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("deleted document using JSON.DEL")

	err = rdb.Do(ctx, "JSON.GET", "mydoc").Err()
	if errors.Is(err, redis.Nil) {
		fmt.Println("document 'mydoc' could not be found")
	}
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To run the above code, copy it to a file named &lt;code&gt;main.go&lt;/code&gt; and execute the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" lang="bash"&gt;# get dependencies
go get github.com/redis/go-redis/v9

# run program
go run main.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should see the following output:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" lang="bash"&gt;JSON.GET result - {"name":"John","credits":30,"cars":["honda","toyota"]}
added audi to list of cars using JSON.ARRAPPEND
latest document {"name":"John","credits":30,"cars":["honda","toyota","audi"]}
incremented credits by 5 using JSON.NUMINCRBY
updated name using JSON.STRAPPEND
latest document {"name":"John, Jr.","credits":35,"cars":["honda","toyota","audi"]}
deleted document using JSON.DEL
document 'mydoc' could not be found&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that we did not need to fetch the entire JSON document to update it. RedisJSON provides granular operations to work with JSON data, thereby resulting in increased application performance (reduced latency) and reduced costs (reduced network bandwidth).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redisearch-1"&gt;RediSearch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The below example demonstrates how to use various RediSearch commands in a Go application. Note the usage&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-go"&gt;redisearch-go&lt;/a&gt;client.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-go" lang="go"&gt;package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"strconv"

	"github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-go/redisearch"
	"github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis"
)

var pool *redis.Pool
var client *redisearch.Client

var cities = []string{"new york", "london", "paris"}

func init() {
	pool = &amp;amp;redis.Pool{Dial: func() (redis.Conn, error) {
		return redis.Dial("tcp", "localhost:6379")
	}}

	client = redisearch.NewClientFromPool(pool, "user-index")
}

func main() {

	schema := redisearch.NewSchema(redisearch.DefaultOptions).
		AddField(redisearch.NewTextFieldOptions("name", redisearch.TextFieldOptions{})).
		AddField(redisearch.NewTextFieldOptions("city", redisearch.TextFieldOptions{}))

	indexDefinition := redisearch.NewIndexDefinition().AddPrefix("user:")

	client.CreateIndexWithIndexDefinition(schema, indexDefinition)

	fmt.Println("redisearch index created")

	conn := pool.Get()

	for i := 1; i &amp;lt;= 10; i++ {

		hashName := "user:" + strconv.Itoa(i)
		val := redis.Args{hashName}.AddFlat(map[string]string{"user_id": strconv.Itoa(i), "city": cities[rand.Intn(len(cities))]})

		conn.Do("HSET", val...)

		fmt.Println("created hash -", hashName)
	}

	docs, total, _ := client.Search(redisearch.NewQuery("*"))

	fmt.Println("no. of indexed documents =", total)

	docs, total, _ = client.Search(redisearch.NewQuery("@city:(paris|london)"))

	fmt.Println("found", total, "users in london or paris")
	for _, doc := range docs {
		fmt.Println("document ID -", doc.Id)
		fmt.Println("document attributes -", doc.Properties)
	}

	err := client.DeleteDocument("user:1")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("failed to delete document (hash) user:1", err)
	}
	fmt.Println("deleted document (hash) user:1")

	_, total, _ = client.Search(redisearch.NewQuery("*"))

	fmt.Println("no. of indexed documents =", total)

	err = client.DropIndex(true)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("failed to drop index", err)
	}
	fmt.Println("dropped index and documents")

	_, total, _ = client.Search(redisearch.NewQuery("*"))

	fmt.Println("no. of indexed documents =", total)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To run the above code, copy it to a file named &lt;code&gt;main.go&lt;/code&gt; and execute the following command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" lang="bash"&gt;go get github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-go/redisearch
go get github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis

go run main.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should see the following output:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" lang="bash"&gt;redisearch index created
created hash - user:1
created hash - user:2
created hash - user:3
created hash - user:4
created hash - user:5
created hash - user:6
created hash - user:7
created hash - user:8
created hash - user:9
created hash - user:10
no. of indexed documents = 10
found 7 users in london or paris
document ID - user:1
document attributes - map[city:paris user_id:1]
document ID - user:3
document attributes - map[city:paris user_id:3]
document ID - user:4
document attributes - map[city:paris user_id:4]
document ID - user:5
document attributes - map[city:london user_id:5]
document ID - user:7
document attributes - map[city:london user_id:7]
document ID - user:8
document attributes - map[city:paris user_id:8]
document ID - user:9
document attributes - map[city:london user_id:9]
deleted document (hash) user:1
no. of indexed documents = 9
dropped index and documents
no. of indexed documents = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We used a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Hash&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;as the document, but RediSearch also works with RedisJSON. The index is automatically updated when documents are added or deleted. This example demonstrates simple ones including fetching all documents and filtering by&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;clause on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;attribute to get users who live in &amp;#8220;london&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;paris&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redistimeseries-1"&gt;RedisTimeSeries&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The below example demonstrates how to use various RedisTimeSeries commands in a Go application. Note that we are using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/redistimeseries-go"&gt;redistimeseries-go&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;client.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-go" lang="go"&gt;package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"math/rand"
	"time"

	redistimeseries "github.com/RedisTimeSeries/redistimeseries-go"
)

const tsName = "temperature:living_room"

func main() {
	client := redistimeseries.NewClient("localhost:6379", "", nil)

	// TS.CREATE
	err := client.CreateKeyWithOptions(tsName, redistimeseries.DefaultCreateOptions)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("created time series key", tsName)

	tempOptions := []float64{24, 24.5, 25}
	var storedTS []int64

	for i := 1; i &amp;lt;= 10; i++ {
		// TS.ADD
		res, err := client.AddAutoTs(tsName, tempOptions[(rand.Intn(len(tempOptions)))])
		storedTS = append(storedTS, res)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Millisecond)
	}

	fmt.Println("added time series data")

	// TS.GET
	lastDataPoint, err := client.Get(tsName)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("lastest data point - timestamp: %v, temp: %v\n", lastDataPoint.Timestamp, lastDataPoint.Value)

	// TS.RANGE
	dataPoints, err := client.RangeWithOptions(tsName, storedTS[0], storedTS[len(storedTS)-1], redistimeseries.DefaultRangeOptions)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("TS.RANGE result")

	for _, dp := range dataPoints {
		fmt.Printf("timestamp: %v, temp: %v\n", dp.Timestamp, dp.Value)
	}
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To run the above code, copy it to a file named &lt;code&gt;main.go&lt;/code&gt; and execute the following command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" lang="bash"&gt;go get github.com/RedisTimeSeries/redistimeseries-go
go run main.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should see the following output:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" lang="bash"&gt;created time series key temperature:living_room
added time series data

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redis-modules-best-practices"&gt;Redis Modules: Best practices&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This section covers few best practices to optimize for scalability and performance in real-world deployments of these modules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redisjson-2"&gt;RedisJSON&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize JSON structure for efficient access: When designing your JSON structure, consider the access patterns of your application. Flatten the JSON hierarchy whenever possible to avoid deep nesting. This allows you to access specific fields efficiently without fetching the entire JSON document. Use RedisJSON&amp;#8217;s path expressions to retrieve or modify specific JSON elements without parsing the entire document.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consider memory management and data size: RedisJSON stores JSON documents as Redis strings. Keep in mind that Redis has a maximum string size limit of 512 MB. If your JSON documents are large, consider chunking them into smaller pieces or using compression.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can use RedisJSON as an index for RedisSearch: This integration enables you to perform complex search operations efficiently and retrieve JSON documents based on search criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redisearch-2"&gt;RediSearch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully choose and optimize search schema: When designing your search schema, consider the specific search requirements of your application. Define the fields that need to be searchable and choose appropriate field types (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;numeric&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;tag&lt;/code&gt;). Carefully analyze the data and select the most relevant fields to include in the search index. Avoid including unnecessary fields to minimize the index size and optimize search performance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Leverage query optimization techniques:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;RedisSearch&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides various query optimization techniques to improve search performance. Utilize query filters to reduce the search space and narrow down the results based on specific criteria.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Additionally, consider using stemming, synonyms, and other language-specific analyzers to enhance search accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-redistimeseries-2"&gt;RedisTimeSeries&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the optimal time buckets: Select the appropriate time intervals based on the frequency and granularity of your data. Consider the trade-off between storage space and query performance. Smaller buckets provide more detailed data but result in larger memory usage.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Leverage query optimization techniques: RedisSearch provides various query optimization techniques to improve search performance. Use query filters to reduce the search space and narrow down the results.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use compression and down-sampling: If you have high-frequency data and limited memory resources, consider enabling compression and down-sampling configurations. This helps reduce memory usage without compromising data accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This article provided an introduction to some popular Redis Modules and how they are better compared to the previous solutions using core Redis data structures. It covered their commands along with demonstration of how to use them in your Go applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Redis modules are highly configurable, so make sure to tune them to your specific requirements and be mindful of the best practices when utilizing them in production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is a serverless database?</title>
      <link>https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/what-is-a-serverless-database/</link>
      <description>Before we define what a serverless database is, perhaps we should talk about what serverless means more broadly, and why there seems to be building momentum behind this general paradigm.
What is serverless computing and why is it growing? Broadly, the term serverless refers to a development model in which an application or service is deployed to the cloud and cloud resources (compute, storage, etc.) are allocated to it automatically in near-real-time based on demand.</description>

      <title>CodeSOD: UTF-16 Encoding</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/utf-16-encoding</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let's say you were browsing through some code, and saw a function signature like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-php"&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-function"&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="hljs-title"&gt;changeUTF16&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="hljs-params"&gt; &lt;span class="hljs-variable"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think that function does? Given the name, I suspect it converts a UTF-16 string into some other encoding, or perhaps it changes some other encoding to UTF-16. Either way, the name is fairly unclear, and probably could be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P-O&lt;/strong&gt; sent this in, and let's take a look at what the function actually does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-php"&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// changeUTF16($string)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// method called to convert LDAP string from UTF-8 to UTF-16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// IN: $string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// OUT: returns a UTF-8 string as a UTF-16 one&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// NOTE : in fact, this method returns the UTF-8 chain converted in ISO&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-function"&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="hljs-title"&gt;changeUTF16&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="hljs-params"&gt; &lt;span class="hljs-variable"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;{
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__"&gt;mb_convert_encoding&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class="hljs-variable"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"ISO-8859-1"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt; ).&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"\n"&lt;/span&gt; ;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank the gods for that &lt;code&gt;NOTE&lt;/code&gt; there, which awkwardly describes what the function actually does- it converts a UTF-8 string to an ISO-8859-1 string. ISO-8859 is, notably, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; UTF-16, and in fact, isn't 16 bits at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;- it's just a different 8-bit encoding from UTF-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, none of this ever mattered, because the program worked, but equally clearly the person behind this method had &lt;em&gt;no clue&lt;/em&gt; what character encodings actually meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P-O&lt;/strong&gt; did find that converting this function to a no-op had no impact on the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: So, I actually never really read into how UTF-8 does its encoding, and while I'm not *surprised* that it's variable byte lengths depending on the character, I didn't *know* that. --&gt;&lt;div&gt;

      <title>Response Code Cheat Sheet for Laravel HTTP Client</title>
      <link>https://www.amitmerchant.com/response-code-cheat-sheet-for-laravel-http-client/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Laravel’s &lt;a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/http-client"&gt;HTTP client&lt;/a&gt; is a wrapper around PHP’s &lt;a href="http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/"&gt;Guzzle HTTP Client&lt;/a&gt; library. It provides a fluent interface to communicate with HTTP endpoints. It can be used to make HTTP requests to external APIs or to communicate with your own application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client returns a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Illuminate\Http\Client\Response&lt;/code&gt; object which contains the response from the server. The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; object has several convenient methods to map response codes to meaningful names and to check if the response was successful or not instead of checking the response code manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a handy cheat sheet for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Response Code&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Method (&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;200 OK&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;ok()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;201 Created&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;created()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;202 Accepted&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;accepted()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;204 No Content&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;noContent()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;301 Moved Permanently&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;movedPermanently()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;302 Found&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;found()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;400 Bad Request&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;badRequest()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;401 Unauthorized&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;unauthorized()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;402 Payment Required&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;paymentRequired()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;forbidden()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;notFound()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;408 Request Timeout&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;requestTimeout()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;409 Conflict&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;conflict()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;422 Unprocessable Entity&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;unprocessableEntity()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;429 Too Many Requests&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$response-&amp;gt;tooManyRequests()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

      <title>Introducing notifications for HTTP Traffic Anomalies</title>
      <link>http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-http-traffic-anomalies-notifications/</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="Introducing notifications for HTTP Traffic Anomalies" class="kg-image" height="1350" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Traffic-anomalies-1.png" width="2401" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to managing Internet properties, the difference between a small technical hiccup and major incident is often a matter of speed. Proactive alerting plays a crucial role, which is why we were excited when we released &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/smarter-origin-service-level-monitoring/"&gt;HTTP Error Rate notifications&lt;/a&gt; — giving administrators visibility into when end users are experiencing errors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if there are issues that don't show up as errors, like a sudden drop in traffic, or a spike? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we're excited to announce Traffic Anomalies notifications, available to enterprise customers. These notifications trigger when Cloudflare detects unexpected changes in traffic, giving another valuable perspective into the health of your systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpected changes in traffic could be indicative of many things. If you run an ecommerce site and see a spike in traffic that could be great news — maybe customers are flocking to your sale, or you just had an ad run on a popular TV show. However, it could also mean that something is going wrong: maybe someone accidentally turned off a firewall rule, and now you’re seeing more malicious traffic. Either way, you might want to know that something has changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a sudden drop in traffic could mean many things. Perhaps it’s Friday afternoon and all of your employees are signing off and no longer accessing your company website. Or maybe a link to your site is broken, and now potential customers aren’t able to access it. You could be losing potential revenue every minute that traffic is low, so you’d want to know as soon as possible to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="how-can-we-tell-when-to-alert"&gt;How can we tell when to alert? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculating anomalies in time series datasets is difficult to do well. The simplest way to do it is to use basic thresholds. However, as we’ve &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/smarter-origin-service-level-monitoring/"&gt;previously blogged about&lt;/a&gt;, simple thresholds aren’t very accurate when trying to determine when things are actually going wrong. There are too many edge cases for them to work effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculating anomalies in HTTP errors is relatively easy. We know that in general there should be a very low number of errors, so any spike is bad and therefore alertable. That’s why we use &lt;a href="https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/"&gt;Service Level Objectives (SLOs)&lt;/a&gt; to calculate anomalies for our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/notification-available/#traffic-monitoring"&gt;HTTP Error Rate notifications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, analyzing overall HTTP traffic behaves more similarly to &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-thresholds-in-security-event-alerting-a-z-score-love-story/"&gt;Cloudflare Security Events&lt;/a&gt;: there’s some general baseline of events that is computed from historical trends. Any deviation from that baseline is alertable. Because of those similarities, we decided to use the same calculations for Traffic Anomalies notifications as we have previously used for Security Event notifications: &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/get-notified-when-your-site-is-under-attack/"&gt;z-scores&lt;/a&gt;. This involves comparing the current value to the average over a period of time. However, many standard deviations away from the average the current value is, is the z-score. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="898" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image4-6.png" width="1292" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plot of HTTP traffic against z-scores. The blue is the HTTP traffic, purple is the positive z-score bound of the traffic, and green is the negative z-score bound of the traffic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Traffic Anomalies notifications, we’re comparing the traffic over the past 5 minutes (the short window) to the average of the traffic over the past 4 hours (the long window). Positive z-scores indicate a spike, and negative z-scores indicate a drop. If the current value is more than 3.5 standard deviations away from the average, we alert. We measure every 5 minutes, so we can alert on any traffic spike or drop in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="125" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image2-9.png" width="1375" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green bucket is the long window and the red bucket is the short window&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our Security Event notifications only trigger when there is a spike in security events (a drop is almost always a good thing), in the case of Traffic Anomalies we send notifications for both spikes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; drops. This is because a drop of HTTP traffic is likely indicative of a problem, and a surge could be good or bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with Security Events, Traffic Anomalies notifications support &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-thresholds-in-security-event-alerting-a-z-score-love-story/"&gt;minimum thresholds&lt;/a&gt;. This means that, even if we determine that an event is outside 3.5 standard deviations, if the number of events is insignificant, we don’t alert. A spike must be at least 200 requests, and a drop must fall by at least 200 requests. This makes the notifications less noisy, since we aren’t alerting on small spikes and drops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="digging-a-little-deeper"&gt;Digging a little deeper&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare stores sampled statistics on requests that go through its network &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/http-analytics-for-6m-requests-per-second-using-clickhouse/"&gt;in Clickhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Every minute, we take HTTP traffic from Clickhouse and store it in an instance of VictoriaMetrics, a time-series data storage solution. VictoriaMetrics gives us out-of-the-box algorithmic functions for free, and it has been a good fit for our use case. We chose VictoriaMetrics for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it's easy to configure and operate. As a team, we want to optimize for low operational burden and VictoriaMetrics has been great thus far. Secondly, VictoriaMetrics has the ability to scale horizontally, meaning we can run it in a highly available mode. For a system such as this where we want something reliable to compute time sensitive information for our customers, the high availability requirement is essential. Finally, in our tests, we found that VictoriaMetrics used around ⅓ of the memory that Prometheus, a similar alternative product, did for the same use case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we have data in VictoriaMetrics, we can run queries against it and determine whether we need to alert our customers or not, based on notification configurations they have created ahead of time. To do this we leverage our existing Alert Notification System, &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/new-tools-to-monitor-your-server-and-avoid-downtime/"&gt;which we blogged about initially in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. We know we can count on our current notification system for the last mile to deliver these critical notifications to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="387" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image1-9.png" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data flow from HTTP request to notification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h6 id="setting-up-the-notification"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting up the Notification &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;To configure this notification, navigate to the “Notifications” tab of the dashboard. Select Traffic Anomalies as your notification type. As with all Cloudflare notifications, you’re able to name and describe your notification, and choose how you want to be notified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="482" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image5-3.png" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traffic Anomalies notification in the Dashboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can choose which domains you want monitored for Traffic Anomalies, whether you want to include traffic that’s already been mitigated by Cloudflare DoS or WAF products, and whether there are specific status codes you want included or excluded. You can also choose whether you want to be alerted on traffic spikes, drops, or both. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to use this system to help serve our Enterprise customers with invaluable notifications regarding the overall health of their systems. Head over to the Notifications tab in the dash to check this new notification out now!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Benefits of an API-driven Approach in Microservices Architecture</title>
      <link>https://8thlight.com/insights/5-benefits-of-an-api-driven-approach-in-microservices-architecture</link>
      <description>&lt;p class="txt-2xl font-semibold"&gt;Microservices architecture is a common approach to building complex software applications, wherein the full system is broken down into a set of small, independent, and loosely coupled services that work together like a team in order to deliver business value. Each service focuses on performing a specific business task, and communicates with other services through lightweight APIs or messaging systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Building scalable and reliable systems with a microservices architecture is a smart approach, but it’s not without challenges. One challenge is managing the large number of APIs that accumulate as the system grows. Each service exposes its own API, which often needs to be consumed by other services. This might lead to a number of problems, including duplication of code, inconsistencies between schemas, poor API documentation, and other miscommunications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a way to mitigate these effects is by taking an API-driven approach and using automation tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;What Is an API-driven Approach?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The API-driven strategy emphasizes the use of APIs as the primary channel of communication between microservices by thinking, defining, and standardizing the API definition first. In this approach, the whole system could be designed without thinking about the implementation, simply by adding an abstract layer. Automation tools help reduce the potential for user error to enter such a critical and complex layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Benefits of an API-driven Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The API-driven approach offers many benefits, which create a more reliable system,and a more predictable development experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;1. Reduces Duplication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Each API needs to be consumed by other services. Using automation tools and generated code reduces the duplication, and makes sure that every service that is consuming the API is using exactly the same implementation, HTTP library, and error handlings as others. By taking this approach, not only is the API implementation standardized, it also ensures that the client usages are the same. You decide on a library that works best for your design and use it across the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;2. Simplifies Validation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Large organizations often institute strict naming conventions and rules for their services. Taking this approach makes validation easier within pipelines. You can read more about &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/naming_convention" target="_blank"&gt;API naming convention from Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Also, you can enjoy some basic validation for the user inputs for free. For example, in your specification, you define a parameter as required and the user is forced to provide a value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;3. Creates Built-in Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Consuming an API requires some amount of knowledge about the API’s path, parameters, request body and response, authentication, and more. This information is traditionally stored in API documentation, but keeping documentation updated over a long time poses a challenge, and might be forgotten during the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With an API-driven approach, teams are forced to think and design the API's information before implementing it. Whenever you update something in the specification, the changes are automatically applied to your documentation, meaning you can’t miss a newly added parameter or a change in the status codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;4. Avoids Inconsistency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In most cases, models are used when implementing the API request or response body. When consuming APIs, each service creates its own version of the API models, which might result in inconsistencies between server output and the client version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Imagine that, when services get updated, they introduce or update new fields. All services need to update their own models to use the updated version. This process is complicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Using an API-driven approach, clients of your API don’t need to create their own version of models. They simply use the generated version, which mirrors the server’s version. If an API changes or updates to a new version, you simply need to update the library that exposes the new API and use the new method generated for you with the latest model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;5. Implements Automated Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Automatically generating tests from specification comes with several benefits that enhances efficiency, accuracy, and maintainability of the API development process. It saves time, makes sure that the contract specified in the design is tested accurately, and improves test coverage. Automated testing tools provide confidence that APIs and models are working as expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In conclusion, API-driven development is essential in microservices architecture, especially for efficiency and consistency. It simplifies the complexities of service integrations and reduces code redundancy. Through automated testing and built-in documentation, it ensures that each microservice is reliable and well-documented, promoting a strong and flexible micro-services system. In another article, I explained how to &lt;a href="https://8thlight.com/insights/step-by-step-guide-to-develop-a-microservice-based-application-utilizing-an-api-driven-approach"&gt;follow the API-Driven approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Step-Up Authentication Examples With Okta</title>
      <link>https://developer.okta.com/blog/2023/10/24/stepup-okta</link>
      <description>&lt;h2 id="step-up-authentication-with-okta-workforce-identity-cloud"&gt;Step-up Authentication with Okta Workforce Identity Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step-up authentication in an application is a pattern of allowing access to non-critical resources using basic level of authentication, and requiring additional authentications for critical resources. This has the effect of providing a balance between frictionless user experience and security in an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several methodologies to provide the functionality as discussed &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2023/03/08/step-up-auth"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we will explore few ways &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/workforce-identity/"&gt;Okta Workforce Identity Cloud (WIC)&lt;/a&gt; can support step-up authentication in an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="modern-application-using-openid-connect-oidc"&gt;Modern Application using OpenID Connect (OIDC)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="using-acr-values"&gt;Using ACR values&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WIC supports &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;acr_values&lt;/code&gt; (Authentication Context Class Reference values) parameter as defined in &lt;a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationEndpoint"&gt;OIDC specification&lt;/a&gt; to provide the step-up authentication functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Application using &lt;strong&gt;OIDC&lt;/strong&gt; for authentication- It can be a web, single page application (SPA) or native mobile application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The need is to maintain a basic assurance level for a user session after user initially authenticates to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the user accesses a sensitive resource, she should be prompted for step-up authentication using additional authentication factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once step-up is successful, the user session should move to a higher assurance level for a specified duration of time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next time the sensitive resource is accessed within the stipulated period, no more challenges should be presented, ensuring a relatively friction-less user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;OIDC&lt;/strong&gt;, the above behavior is achievable using &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;acr_values&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;max_age&lt;/code&gt; parameters of the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;/authorize&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WIC has in-built support for these parameters. The behavior is available in both &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/redirect-vs-embedded/#redirect-authentication"&gt;redirect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/redirect-vs-embedded/#embedded-authentication"&gt;embedded deployment models&lt;/a&gt;, and is supported by both &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#org-authorization-server"&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#custom-authorization-server"&gt;Custom&lt;/a&gt; authorization servers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following diagram describes how WIC processes &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;acr_values&lt;/code&gt; during &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;/authorize&lt;/code&gt; call:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ACR flow diagram" src="https://developer.okta.com/assets-jekyll/blog/step-up-okta/1-step-up-authentication-acr-flow-5d30654bb07cf0dd6b94c4a2eef713cb9b2cc901ba858035f68216a6847eaee2.jpg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently WIC supports a pre-defined &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/step-up-authentication/main/#predefined-parameter-values"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;acr_values&lt;/code&gt;. These values are mapped to assurance levels supported in WIC &lt;a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/identity-engine/policies/about-app-sign-on-policies.htm"&gt;authentication policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The non-Okta specific defined values such as &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;phr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;phrh&lt;/code&gt; are taken from &lt;a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-eap-acr-values-1_0.html#OpenID.PAPE"&gt;this OIDC spec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/step-up-authentication/main/"&gt;Okta Developer step-up authentication guide&lt;/a&gt; describes the process in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitation&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently it is not possible to define custom &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;acr_values&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentication API example, requesting step-up authentication. Note the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;acr_values&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;max_age&lt;/code&gt; parameters in the API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize?client_id={clientId}
&amp;amp;response_type=code
&amp;amp;scope=openid
&amp;amp;redirect_uri=https://${yourOktaDomain}/authorization-code/callback
&amp;amp;state=296bc9a0-a2a2-4a57-be1a-d0e2fd9bb601
&amp;amp;acr_values=urn:okta:loa:2fa:any
&amp;amp;max_age=30
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js"&gt;Okta Auth JS SDK&lt;/a&gt; equivalent of the above API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect(
{acrValues: urn:okta:loa:2fa:any, maxAge: 0}
);  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refer to this &lt;a href="https://github.com/indranilokg/WIC/tree/main/Step%20Up%20Authentication"&gt;sample app&lt;/a&gt; for a complete working example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="re-authenticate-only"&gt;Re-authenticate (only)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Application using &lt;strong&gt;OIDC&lt;/strong&gt; for authentication- It can be a web, single page application (SPA) or native mobile application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time the user accesses sensitive area of an application, she needs to be prompted for re-authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OIDC&lt;/strong&gt; supports such a scenario &lt;a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html"&gt;implicitly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The application will initiate a new OIDC authorization request with WIC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The request will have the value for the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prompt&lt;/code&gt; parameter &lt;strong&gt;login&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WIC will then force re-authentication (even if there is an existing session).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentication API example, requesting re-authentication. Note the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prompt&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize?client_id={clientId}
&amp;amp;response_type=code
&amp;amp;scope=openid
&amp;amp;redirect_uri=https://${yourOktaDomain}/authorization-code/callback
&amp;amp;state=296bc9a0-a2a2-4a57-be1a-d0e2fd9bb601
&amp;amp;prompt=login
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js"&gt;Okta Auth JS SDK&lt;/a&gt; equivalent of the above API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect({prompt: "login"}); 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refer to this &lt;a href="https://github.com/indranilokg/WIC/tree/main/Step%20Up%20Authentication"&gt;sample app&lt;/a&gt; for a complete working example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="factor-api"&gt;Factor API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about applications that don’t use OIDC?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any web, desktop or native application, not using OIDC to integrate with WIC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A secure middleware/business layer is available to the application, such as in 3-tiered web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WIC supports standalone authenticator/factor operations through the &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/factors/"&gt;factor API&lt;/a&gt;. Applications can leverage those factor APIs to implement step-up authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A secure middleware/business layer is needed for server-side processing. This is because the factor APIs are privileged and need to use a static &lt;a href="https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/API.htm"&gt;Okta API token&lt;/a&gt;. The API tokens used need to be properly protected. &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/books/api-security/api-keys/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are some guidelines on API token security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grab the Okta User ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the user id is available from the ID token issued during authentication process (&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; claim), or through &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#list-users"&gt;user management API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "family_name": "Silverman",
    "given_name": "Indranil",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "name": "Jha",
    "preferred_username": "myemail@myemaildomain.com",
    "sub": "00u9vme99nxudvxZA0h7",
    "updated_at": 1490198843,
    "zoneinfo": "America/Los_Angeles"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users?search=profile.login+eq+%22login%40example.com%22"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the Factor ID for the enrolled user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Factor ID is available from the &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/factors/#list-enrolled-factors"&gt;factor management API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users/00u15s1KDETTQMQYABRL/factors"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example: Issue an SMS Factor challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -v -X POST \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${api_token}" \
-d '{
}' "https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users/00u15s1KDETTQMQYABRL/factors/smsszf1YNUtGWTx4j0g3/verify"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example: Verify an SMS Factor challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -v -X POST \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${api_token}" \
-d '{
  "passCode": "123456"
}' "https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users/00u15s1KDETTQMQYABRL/factors/smsszf1YNUtGWTx4j0g3/verify"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="okta-access-gateway"&gt;Okta Access Gateway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legacy web application supporting header based authentication&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The application is integrated with WIC leveraging &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/products/access-gateway/"&gt;Okta Access Gateway(OAG)&lt;/a&gt; Web Access Management (WAM) solution&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OAG can enforce step-up authentication for sensitive resources by cleverly crafting the &lt;a href="https://help.okta.com/oag/en-us/Content/Topics/Access-Gateway/advanced-oag-policy-development.htm"&gt;advanced policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="transactional-mfa"&gt;Transactional MFA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transactional MFA is a close cousin of step-up authentication. In some step-up cases, transactional MFA can be used instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;User authenticates to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point the user tries to access a sensitive resource.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;User receives a push notification in her mobile to approve the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once approved, the access is granted to the resource.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okta supports the above transactional MFA scenario using &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-ciba/main/"&gt;OIDC Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow (CIBA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will look at CIBA based scenario in more detail in a later article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="in-summary"&gt;In summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you application is using modern protocols such as OpenID Connect or built from legacy technologies, Okta’s Workforce Identity Cloud can help you prompt users to step-up their authentication only when necessary for accessing sensitive resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文介绍了HashiCorp发布的Terraform provider代码生成技术预览，通过使用OpenAPI specification来自动生成Terraform provider代码，解决了现有代码生成工具的问题。这个新的生态系统可以大大减轻项目维护的负担，并提供更多的代码一致性。HashiCorp提供了三种工具，包括provider code specification、OpenAPI provider spec generator和framework code generator，以支持不同的开发需求。同时，文章还提供了使用示例和入门指南，帮助用户快速上手并提供反馈。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, we are excited to announce a tech preview of HashiCorp Terraform provider code generation, consisting of a suite of tools that generate &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin"&gt;Terraform provider&lt;/a&gt; code from an &lt;a href="https://www.openapis.org/"&gt;OpenAPI specification&lt;/a&gt;. Included in this preview is a provider code specification that lets developers extend code generation to work with their own tooling and development practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A new ecosystem for Terraform provider code generation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providers are executable binaries written in the Go language that act as a bridge between Terraform and an API service. Terraform’s ecosystem currently has more than 3,600 providers in the &lt;a href="https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers"&gt;public registry&lt;/a&gt;, of which a majority of the code has been manually developed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridging between API services and Terraform provider code is often repetitive across resources and operations. This repetitive maintenance can result in code consistency issues such as schema definitions missing attributes and validation, or data mapping that has invalid conversions between types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provider maintainers have managed these issues with shared code, linting tools, and in some cases, specialized code generation. Code generation can reduce maintenance burden, as well as create more consistency in the codebase. However, existing provider code generation tooling tends to be very specialized to individual providers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HashiCorp Terraform provider code generation tech preview introduces a scalable code generation ecosystem based on a shared specification that can be extended by the existing provider developer community. HashiCorp is offering three general-purpose solutions to bootstrap the ecosystem that can be used together or independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/code-generation/specification"&gt;provider code specification&lt;/a&gt; is a versioned interface, implemented with a JSON schema, upon which specialized provider code generation tools can be based.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/code-generation/openapi-generator"&gt;OpenAPI provider spec generator&lt;/a&gt; is a CLI tool that transforms an OpenAPI 3.x specification into a provider code specification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/code-generation/framework-generator"&gt;framework code generator&lt;/a&gt; is a CLI tool that generates &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework"&gt;Terraform plugin framework&lt;/a&gt; code from a provider code specification. This tool currently generates schema and data modeling provider code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your Terraform provider interacts with an API service that is documented with an OpenAPI specification, you could use all of the available tools to generate provider code, as shown here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Generate" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1697571159-openapi-diagram-white.jpg" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if your API service uses a different interface definition language (IDL), such as Protobuf, you may prefer to build your own provider spec generator specific to your API, then use the available framework code generator, as shown here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PKI的介绍，包括常见的应用场景和核心流程&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;云端PKI和HCP Vault，包括服务模型和优势&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HashiCorp为PKI提供的解决方案&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文探讨了在云端和自管理环境中托管PKI环境的因素和考虑事项。云端PKI在降低操作负担、提高安全性、控制成本、可靠性和易用性方面具有优势。然而，自管理PKI在满足特定的合规性和监管要求方面更加灵活。HashiCorp的HCP Vault和Vault Enterprise提供了满足不同需求的PKI解决方案。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many organizations are leveraging SaaS solutions for public key infrastructure (PKI) to protect their workloads in the cloud. However, PKI running in self-managed environments also remains a popular choice, and is a requirement for some highly regulated industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are important factors organizations need to consider before deciding which option is the best choice for their requirements, but the advantages of cloud-based PKI versus an on-premises approach are not always well understood. This blog explores the factors organizations should consider when deciding how to host their PKI environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PKI explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PKI is the standard process for provisioning and maintaining digital certificates for authentication and encryption of digital identities associated with users, devices, and applications. Common PKI use cases include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL and TLS certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Device and endpoint certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code signing certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital signatures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing access to APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate-based VPNs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a simplified illustration of the core PKI process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="PKI" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1697504081-pki-process.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public key cryptography is the foundation of PKI. It is a strong encryption mechanism that relies on public and private key pairs. The keys are used together to encrypt and decrypt messages based on cryptographic algorithms, helping to protect identities and data from unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cloud PKI and HCP Vault&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of this post, cloud PKI refers to a service or hosting model in the cloud where a service provider hosts and manages the infrastructure and the customer is responsible for the certificate authority (CA), as well as the PKI environment for provisioning and managing certificates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With self-managed PKI, workloads may be hosted in a cloud environment or a more traditional on-premises datacenter. With a self-managed approach, the organization is responsible for maintaining the PKI infrastructure and operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look into the delivery models for &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault"&gt;HashiCorp Vault&lt;/a&gt; can help make it clear what options are available and which one might be best for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HashiCorp’s cloud PKI functionality resides in &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault"&gt;HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault&lt;/a&gt;. HCP Vault is a fully managed implementation of Vault operated by HashiCorp, allowing organizations to get up and running quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an organization chooses to allow a public connection, the HCP Vault cluster will have an associated public address where clients can directly connect to Vault. (Most organizations disable the public connection for security reasons.) The organization can then establish a peering connection between its cloud provider and a HashiCorp virtual network (HVN). This ensures that only trusted clients (users, applications, containers, etc.) running in the peered public cloud provider can connect to Vault and stops systems outside of the selected network from attempting to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="PKI" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1697504191-pki-infrastructure.png" /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of PKI on HCP Vault&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running PKI on HCP enables users to secure, store, and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys within one unified cloud-based platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key benefits of running cloud PKI on HCP Vault include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced operational overhead:&lt;/strong&gt; Push-button deployment as well as fully managed upgrades and backups mean organizations can focus on adoption and integration instead of operational overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased security across clouds and machines:&lt;/strong&gt; HCP Vault allows organizations to secure their globally diverse infrastructure and applications through a single management interface, to restrict access to sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced operating costs due to HashiCorp's engineers running and maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; HashiCorp has experience supporting thousands of commercial Vault clusters and HCP Vault brings that expertise directly to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of use:&lt;/strong&gt; HCP Vault is built around making onboarding its cloud security automation simple. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of self-managed PKI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A managed product like HCP Vault brings many benefits, but organizations should also consider their particular needs when choosing how and where to host their PKI environment. Frequently, those needs are driven by compliance and regulatory requirements associated with specific industries, where self-managed hosting may be appropriate. Self-managed Vault comes in two editions: A free community edition for small use cases, and Vault Enterprise for larger organizations or organizations with stricter security requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of a running a self-managed PKI environment with Vault include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control:&lt;/strong&gt; The certificate provisioning, revocation, and rotation process is within your control, and you are not limited when accessing the cloud. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; On-premises management can be more flexible in terms of customization based on the requirements and capacity of the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-reliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Since critical data is kept in-house, configuration changes can be done on-premises and on your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security and compliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud service providers don’t always support the compliance and standards required for particular industries. Self-managed environments allow organizations to customize their environments for their specific compliance needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;HashiCorp and PKI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, both cloud-based and self-managed PKI solutions have their pros and cons. That’s why HashiCorp offers multiple ways to address your PKI needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud PKI offers agility, ease of use, and reduced operational overhead, whereas self-managed PKI offers more options to customize and meet specific security and compliance requirements. HashiCorp can meet your organization’s needs for not only both types of PKI, but both cloud-based or self-managed certificate lifecycle management platforms (CLM), which is a broader effort to secure identity information and implement data protection to secure your users, devices, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Safe URLs 101: Spotting the Red Flags</title>
      <link>https://catonmat.net/safe-urls-101</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TLDR: You can use &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; (that I and my team built) to check if a URL is safe or not. We run browsers in the cloud in virtual machines and you get a remote connection to a browser. This way, you can open any bad URLs without the risk of infecting your device as everything runs in this this remote browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world has become digitally interconnected, the importance of being able to discern between safe and unsafe URLs has never been more relevant. Unsafe URLs can lead to malware infections, phishing attempts, and breaches of personal data. In this article, I'll tell you everything I know (I have 20 years of experience in web security) about how to distinguish between safe and unsafe URLs and how to use &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; to spot and avoid these digital landmines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the URL structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before delving into the signs of an unsafe URL, it's crucial to know the basic parts of a URL. A URL can be broken into seven parts: protocol scheme, subdomain, domain, top level domain (TLD), path, query string, and anchor. Let's look at each part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protocol Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the initial part of a web address that determines the communication protocol or a program that will be used to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;mailto&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;, which is secure version of the HTTP protocol used for online communication, ensuring data is encrypted and transmitted safely between a user's device and a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Domain Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main part of a web address. It's a human-readable address that uniquely identifies a website or online resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yahoo.com&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;digg.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subdomain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the optional part before a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;shop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;, which is a commonly used prefix in web addresses, denoting &amp;quot;World Wide Web&amp;quot;, and it serves as a standard subdomain for almost all websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Top-Level Domain (TLD)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending segment of a web address, indicating the domain's type, category or country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.it&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A specific page on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/account&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;/resources/free/downloads&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/blog&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt;, which leads users to the blog section or another page of a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Query String&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part starts with a question mark &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and allows sending parameters to a page, and it's often in the format of &lt;code&gt;key=value&lt;/code&gt; pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;?id=123&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?search=python&amp;amp;sort=date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=puppies&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;?q=puppies&lt;/code&gt;, which loads the search query for puppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anchor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anchor is used to direct you to a specific section of a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;#footer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;#tools&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/blog#top-posts&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;#top-posts&lt;/code&gt;, which scrolls the webpage to the top posts section of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Full URL Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;https://www.google.com/blog/post?id=123#tools&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheme: &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subdomain: &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain Name: &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-Level Domain (TLD): &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path: &lt;code&gt;/blog/post&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query String: &lt;code&gt;?id=123&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor: &lt;code&gt;#tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spotting Unsafe URLs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 15 signs that can help you identify and avoid unsafe URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Mismatched URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hover over a link to see where it leads to. If the hover link doesn't match the URL or the title in the text, be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a ligature used in place of a letter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says &lt;code&gt;Bank of America&lt;/code&gt; but hover is &lt;code&gt;bankofarnerica.com&lt;/code&gt; (the letters &amp;quot;rn&amp;quot; are combined together to create a ligature that looks like letter &amp;quot;m&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a number used as a letter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says &lt;code&gt;PayPal&lt;/code&gt; but it hovers as &lt;code&gt;paypa1.com&lt;/code&gt; (digit &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; is used in place of the letter el - &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Misspelled Domains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typos or slight variations of popular domain names can lead to malicious websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of misspelled Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You search for a book and click on a link that seems to lead to &lt;code&gt;amazon.com&lt;/code&gt;, but a closer look reveals it says &lt;code&gt;amazom.com&lt;/code&gt; (last letter is &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of misspelled Facebook&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You try logging into &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt; but find yourself at &lt;code&gt;facebokk.com&lt;/code&gt; instead (instead of &amp;quot;book&amp;quot;, it says &amp;quot;bokk&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Unicode characters in URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs that contain fake Unicode characters pose a great danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a homoglyph attack&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching for a Samsung phone update, you find a link to &lt;code&gt;ѕаmѕung.соm&lt;/code&gt;. It turns out this address is fake as it replaces standard characters with visually similar Unicode characters (called homoglyphs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a Punycode deception&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're searching for a security product and visit &lt;code&gt;security.com&lt;/code&gt; but after visiting, your browser shows &lt;code&gt;xn--scurity-w4a.com&lt;/code&gt; in the address bar. The real address was &lt;code&gt;sécurity.com&lt;/code&gt; and the browser converted it to an international domain name (IDN) encoding called Punycode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Unusual Top-Level Domain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncommon TLDs that don't align with the site's supposed purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a government website at a .kim domain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for a government service, you stumble upon &lt;code&gt;GovernmentAgency.kim&lt;/code&gt;, which doesn't feel official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a clothing brand's website at a .horse domain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for an Italian clothing brand's site but land on &lt;code&gt;ItalianBrand.horse&lt;/code&gt;, which seems inconsistent with their product line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Excessive Redirects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs that send you through multiple sites rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake online deal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're hoping to snag an online deal at &lt;code&gt;greatoffer90.com&lt;/code&gt;, but you find yourself being bounced between multiple unrelated websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake movie website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trying to watch a movie on &lt;code&gt;freemoviesnow.com&lt;/code&gt; but the page keeps shifting and redirecting, never settling on the content you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. URL Shorteners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services that conceal the end destination of a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a bit.ly link&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend sends you a &lt;code&gt;bit.ly&lt;/code&gt; link (such as &lt;code&gt;bit.ly/XXXXX&lt;/code&gt; and you can't determine its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a tinyurl.com link&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email offers a great discount, but the link is a shortened &lt;code&gt;tinyurl.com/XXXXX&lt;/code&gt;, hiding its true endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Generic Greetings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emails or messages that come with vague salutations instead of personalized greetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an impersonal account update email&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email asks you to update your account details &lt;code&gt;for security reasons&lt;/code&gt; with a link reading &lt;code&gt;accountupdate.com&lt;/code&gt; and an impersonal greeting of &lt;code&gt;Dear valued member&lt;/code&gt; (instead of your name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a lucky visitor popup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notification pops up, claiming you're a lucky visitor and you've won a prize and urging you to visit &lt;code&gt;surprisewin.com&lt;/code&gt; with the salutation &lt;code&gt;Hello user&lt;/code&gt; (instead of your name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Unsolicited Invitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected URLs from known and unknown senders can be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an invitation to an unknown photo site&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from an unknown sender urging you to see an amazing photo at &lt;code&gt;checkoutthisphoto.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an invitation to view a PDF file&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive a message saying a colleague has shared a PDF document on &lt;code&gt;seemyresume.net&lt;/code&gt;, but you weren't expecting any such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. Too-Good-To-Be-True Offers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promising deals or prizes that seem too generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a link to huge winnings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ad claims you can win a million dollars instantly, directing you to &lt;code&gt;win-1million-now.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unexpected prize&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive an email promising a free top-end smartphone for every form that you fill at &lt;code&gt;freesmartphones.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Alarmist Messages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites that induce panic to make you act quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a popup asking you to act quickly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pop-up warns of suspicious activity on your account and insists you visit &lt;code&gt;urgent-account-alert.com&lt;/code&gt; to resolve it or else your account will be suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an alert telling your PC has been infected with a virus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alert pops up saying your PC has been infected with a virus and asks you to fix your PC by visiting &lt;code&gt;instant-pcfixer.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. Grammar and Spelling Errors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes in the URL and link text can indicate deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a login page with a typo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trying to access a login page and you find the link reads &lt;code&gt;officiall-login.com&lt;/code&gt;, with a duplicate letter &amp;quot;el&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a grammar and spelling error in text surrounding the link&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive an email from an online payment service but it says &lt;code&gt;Varifay, your acount to login&lt;/code&gt;, with terrible grammar and spelling errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. Inconsistent Branding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website's design or URL structure doesn't match the known branding of a reputed entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a broken logo on Google's login page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You click on a Google login page, but something feels off. The page URL &lt;code&gt;google-securelogin.com&lt;/code&gt; and the logo is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake Apple support page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Apple support, the site you land on has a web address &lt;code&gt;applesupports.org&lt;/code&gt;, which is nicely made, but doesn't align with Apple's official domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;13. No Contact Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absence of genuine contact details on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake product support site&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an issue with a product, you try reaching out via &lt;code&gt;contactsupportnow.com&lt;/code&gt;, but the site has just one page and lacks any genuine contact details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a page with no contact details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needing customer care, &lt;code&gt;customercareinfo.net&lt;/code&gt; appears to offer support but has no phone number or physical address listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;14. Unexpected Software Downloads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs that initiate unsolicited software or file downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unexpected download&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to listen to some new music tracks, you click on &lt;code&gt;freemusicdownloader.com&lt;/code&gt;, only for it to start downloading an unexpected executable file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a download without your consent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend suggests a cool new app, but &lt;code&gt;getthisappnow.com&lt;/code&gt; initiates an unsolicited software download without your consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;15. Lack of HTTPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A missing secure protocol can indicate the site isn't encrypted, which can lead to personal data and credit card exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unsafe banking website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A banking website that doesn't use https: &lt;code&gt;http://yourbanklogin.com&lt;/code&gt;. Here instead of &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; it uses &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unsafe payment portal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secure payments portal that doesn't use HTTPS: &lt;code&gt;http://secure-paymentportal.com&lt;/code&gt;. Here, again, it uses unsecure &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol instead of secure &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Browserling Can Help You Spot Unsafe URLs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I dove deep into 15 key signs that can help you identify potentially malicious URLs, it's essential to understand that the digital landscape of unsafe URLs is vast and ever-evolving. In many respects, I've just skimmed the surface of the complex world of cybersecurity threats related to URLs. Fortunately, my service &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; stands as a bulwark against these diverse threats and offers a secure layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Browserling?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browserling is a web-based service that offers real-time remote access to sandboxed browsers that allow users to run browsers from different operating systems directly in their own browser. As the browsers are sandboxed, the browsing sessions are isolated, making it especially useful for testing potentially unsafe URLs without risking one's own system or data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interactive Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browserling isn't just a passive tool. It offers a live and interactive browsing experience that can help security professionals recognize unusual site behaviors, from unexpected redirects to aggressive pop-ups, and other potential red flags not covered in the initial 15 signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cross-Browser Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals sometimes exploit browser-specific and platform-specific vulnerabilities. For example, they might target Chrome version 115 that runs on Windows 10. Browserling's capability to test URLs across multiple browsers and platforms means you're not just looking for general threats, but also those that are browser-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zero Additional Risks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no required downloads, installs, or extensions, Browserling ensures that your safety isn't compromised by adding potential vulnerabilities. Every interaction is web-based, keeping a safe distance from potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clean State Every Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each session with Browserling is temporary and wiped clean after use. This clean up of session data guarantees that no malware, viruses, cookies, or trackers linger post-investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Secure Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browserling prioritizes user data privacy and security with SSL-encrypted connections. This ensures that, while you're investigating a URL, your connection remains invisible to potential eavesdroppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of unsafe URLs extends far beyond the 15 signs I initially outlined. With Browserling, users are equipped with an advanced tool offering both breadth and depth in analysis and defense against the countless URL-based cyber threats. &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com/browse"&gt;Give it a try&lt;/a&gt; and browse safe!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Python's F-String for String Interpolation and Formatting</title>
      <link>https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python &lt;strong&gt;f-strings&lt;/strong&gt; provide a quick way to &lt;strong&gt;interpolate&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;format&lt;/strong&gt; strings. They’re readable, concise, and less prone to error than traditional string interpolation and formatting tools, such as the &lt;code&gt;.format()&lt;/code&gt; method and the modulo operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;). An f-string is also a bit faster than those tools!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know why f-strings are such a powerful tool that you should learn and master as a Python developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpolate&lt;/strong&gt; values, objects, and expressions into your strings using &lt;strong&gt;f-strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Format&lt;/strong&gt; f-strings using Python’s &lt;strong&gt;string formatting mini-language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage some &lt;strong&gt;cool features&lt;/strong&gt; of f-strings in Python 3.12 and beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide when to use &lt;strong&gt;traditional interpolation&lt;/strong&gt; tools instead of &lt;strong&gt;f-strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with Python’s &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-strings/"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; data type. It’s also be beneficial to have experience with other string interpolation tools like the modulo operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) and the &lt;code&gt;.format()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Your Code:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="alert-link" href="https://realpython.com/bonus/python-f-string-code/"&gt;Click here to download the free sample code&lt;/a&gt; that shows you how to do string interpolation and formatting with Python’s f-strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="interpolating-and-formatting-strings-before-python-36"&gt;Interpolating and Formatting Strings Before Python 3.6&lt;a class="headerlink" href="https://realpython.com/atom.xml#interpolating-and-formatting-strings-before-python-36" title="Permanent link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Python 3.6, you had two main tools for interpolating values, variables, and expressions inside string literals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting"&gt;string interpolation operator&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;), or modulo operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format"&gt;&lt;code&gt;str.format()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll get a refresher on these two string interpolation tools in the following sections. You’ll also learn about the string formatting capabilities that these tools offer in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-modulo-operator"&gt;The Modulo Operator, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a class="headerlink" href="https://realpython.com/atom.xml#the-modulo-operator" title="Permanent link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modulo operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) was the first tool for string interpolation and formatting in Python and has been in the language since the beginning. Here’s what using this operator looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jane"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;!"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;'Hello, Jane!'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this quick example, you use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator to interpolate the value of your &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; variable into a string literal. The interpolation operator takes two operands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A string literal containing one or more conversion specifiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The object or objects that you’re interpolating into the string literal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;conversion specifiers&lt;/strong&gt; work as replacement fields. In the above example, you use the &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; combination of characters as a conversion specifier. The &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; symbol marks the start of the specifier, while the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; letter is the &lt;strong&gt;conversion type&lt;/strong&gt; and tells the operator that you want to convert the input object into a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to insert more than one object into your target string, then you can use a &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-tuple/"&gt;tuple&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the number of objects in the tuple must match the number of format specifiers in the string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jane"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;! You're &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; years old."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;'Hello, Jane! You're 25 years old.'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, you use a tuple of values as the right-hand operand to &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. Note that you’ve used a string and an integer. Because you use the &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; specifier, Python converts both objects to strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use dictionaries as the right-hand operand in your interpolation expressions. To do this, you need to create conversion specifiers that enclose key names in parentheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(name)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;! You're &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(age)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; years old."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jane"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;"Hello, Jane! You're 25 years old."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This syntax provides a readable approach to string interpolation with the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator. You can use descriptive key names instead of relying on the positional order of values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator for string interpolation, you can use conversion specifiers. They provide some string formatting capabilities that take advantage of &lt;strong&gt;conversion types&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;conversion flags&lt;/strong&gt;, and some characters like the period (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) and the asterisk (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;). Consider the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Balance: $&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%.2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;5425.9292&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;'Balance: $5425.93'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Age: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"John"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Name: John&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Age:    35&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first example, you use the &lt;code&gt;%.2f&lt;/code&gt; conversion specifier to represent currency values. The &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; letter tells the operator to convert to a floating-point number. The &lt;code&gt;.2&lt;/code&gt; part defines the precision to use when converting the input. In the second example, you use &lt;code&gt;%5s&lt;/code&gt; to align the age value five positions to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How can I check if I’m on a DispatcherQueue’s thread if I can’t call HasThreadAccess?</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231018-00/?p=108904</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A customer had code that used the &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue.Has­Thread­Access&lt;/code&gt; property, but found that the code crashed when running on Windows Server 2019 systems,¹ because the &lt;code&gt;Has­Thread­Access&lt;/code&gt; property wasn&amp;#8217;t added until Windows Server Version 1903.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wondered if there was a way to find out whether you are running on a &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8216;s thread without using the &lt;code&gt;Has­Thread­Access&lt;/code&gt; property?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let&amp;#8217;s browse around the members of &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Member&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Available in Server 2019?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GetForCurrentThread&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CreateTimer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TryEnqueue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ShutdownStaring&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ShutdownCompleted&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HasThreadAccess&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that you can see if a particular &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt; belongs to the current thread by simply reversing the question: Ask the current thread for its &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt; and see if it&amp;#8217;s the one you were given. This relies on the fact that each thread can have at most one &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;// Alternate version that simulates HasThreadAccess
// on Windows Server 2019.

// C++/WinRT
bool DispatcherQueueHasThreadAccess(DispatcherQueue const&amp;amp; q)
{
    ASSERT(q != nullptr); // caller should have checked this first
    return q == DispatcherQueue::GetForCurrentThread();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer reported back that it worked great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of computer programming is just looking at the tools you have available in your toolbox and seeing whether you can combine them in an interesting way to accomplish your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

These engineers typically have some high level metrics about their network traffic, but they struggle to collect essential information on the specific traffic flows that would clarify the issue. To solve this problem, Cloudflare has been piloting a cloud network flow monitoring product called &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; that gives customers end-to-end visibility into all traffic across their network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Cloudflare is excited to announce that Magic Network Monitoring (previously called &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/flow-based-monitoring-for-magic-transit/"&gt;Flow Based Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;) is now generally available to all enterprise customers. Over the last year, the Cloudflare engineering team has significantly improved Magic Network Monitoring; we’re excited to offer a network services product that will help our customers identify threats faster, reduce vulnerabilities, and make their network more secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring is automatically enabled for all Magic Transit and Magic WAN enterprise customers. The product is located at the account level of the Cloudflare dashboard and can be opened by navigating to “Analytics &amp;amp; Logs &amp;gt; Magic Monitoring”. The onboarding process for Magic Network Monitoring is self-serve, and all enterprise customers with access can begin configuring the product today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any enterprise customers without Magic Transit or Magic WAN that are interested in testing Magic Network Monitoring can receive access to the free version (with some &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/magic-network-monitoring-free/"&gt;limitations&lt;/a&gt; on traffic volume) by submitting a request to their Cloudflare account team or filling out this form to &lt;a href="http://network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;talk with an expert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-magic-network-monitoring"&gt;What is Magic Network Monitoring?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring is a cloud network flow monitor. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_flow_(computer_networking)"&gt;Network traffic flow&lt;/a&gt; refers to any stream of packets between one source and one destination with the same Internet protocol and set of ports. Customers can send network flow reports from their routers (or any other network flow generator) to a publicly available endpoint on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/"&gt;Cloudflare’s anycast network&lt;/a&gt;, even if the traffic didn’t originally pass through Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare analyzes the network flow data, then provides customers visibility into key network traffic metrics via an analytics dashboard. These metrics include: traffic volume (in bits or packets) over time, source IPs, destination IPs, ports, traffic protocols, and router IPs. Customers can also configure alerts to identify &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;DDoS attacks&lt;/a&gt; and any other abnormal traffic volume activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="802" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/1-1.png" width="1435" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Send flow data from your network to Cloudflare for analysis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="enterprise-ddos-attack-type-detection"&gt;Enterprise DDoS attack type detection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/on-demand/"&gt;Magic Transit On Demand&lt;/a&gt; (MTOD) customers will experience significant traffic visibility benefits when using Magic Network Monitoring. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/"&gt;Magic Transit&lt;/a&gt; is a network security solution that offers DDoS protection and traffic acceleration from every Cloudflare data center for on-premise, cloud-hosted, and hybrid networks. Magic Transit On Demand customers can activate Magic Transit for protection when a DDoS attack is detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, we noticed that some MTOD customers lacked the network visibility tools to quickly identify DDoS attacks and take the appropriate mitigation action. Now, MTOD customers can use Magic Network Monitoring to analyze their network data and receive an alert if a DDoS attack is detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="761" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/2-1.png" width="1436" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cloudflare detects a DDoS attack from the customer’s network flow data&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a DDoS attack is detected, Magic Network Monitoring customers can choose to either manually or automatically enable Magic Transit to mitigate any DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="761" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/3-1.png" width="1436" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Activate Magic Transit for DDoS protection&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="enterprise-network-monitoring"&gt;Enterprise network monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s Magic WAN and Cloudflare One customers can also benefit from using Magic Network Monitoring. Today, these customers have excellent visibility into the traffic they send through Cloudflare’s network, but sometimes they may lack visibility into traffic that isn’t sent through Cloudflare. This can include traffic that remains on a local network, or network traffic sent in between cloud environments. Magic WAN and Cloudflare One customers can add Magic Network Monitoring into their suite of product solutions to establish end-to-end network visibility across all traffic on their network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="a-deep-dive-into-network-flow-and-network-traffic-sampling"&gt;A deep dive into network flow and network traffic sampling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring gives customers better visibility into their network traffic by ingesting and analyzing network flow data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process starts when a router (or other network flow generation device) collects &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"&gt;statistical samples&lt;/a&gt; of inbound and / or outbound packet data. These samples are collected by examining 1 in every X packets, where X is the sampling rate configured on the router. Typical sampling rates range from 1 in every 1,000 to 1 in every 4,000 packets. The ideal sampling rate depends on the traffic volume, traffic diversity, and the compute / memory power of your router’s hardware. You can read more about the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/routers/recommended-sampling-rate/"&gt;recommended network flow sampling rate&lt;/a&gt; in Cloudflare’s MNM Developer Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sampled data is packaged into one of two industry standard formats for network flow data: NetFlow or sFlow. In NetFlow, the sampled packet data is grouped by different packet characteristics such as source / destination IP, port, and protocol. Each group of sampled packet data also includes a traffic volume estimate. In sFlow, the entire packet header is selected as the representative sample, and there isn’t any data summarization. As a result, sFlow is a richer data format and includes more details about network traffic than NetFlow data. Once either the NetFlow or sFlow data samples are collected, they’re sent to Magic Network Monitoring for analysis and alerting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="400" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/4-1.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="why-simple-random-sampling-didn%E2%80%99t-work-for-magic-network-monitoring"&gt;Why simple random sampling didn’t work for Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring has come a long way from its early access release one year ago. In particular, the Cloudflare engineering team invested significant time in improving the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations in MNM. In the early access version of Magic Network Monitoring, customers were unexpectedly reporting that their network traffic volume estimates were too high and didn’t match the expected value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring performs its own sampling of the NetFlow or sFlow data it receives, so it can effectively scale and manage the data ingested across Cloudflare’s global network. Increasing the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations was more difficult than expected, as the NetFlow or sFlow data parsed by MNM is already built on sampled packet data. This introduces multiple distinct layers of data sampling in the product’s analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first version of Magic Network Monitoring used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample"&gt;random sampling&lt;/a&gt; where a random subset of network flow data with the same timestamp was selected to represent the traffic volume at that point in time. A characteristic of network flow data is that some samples are more significant than others and represent a greater volume of network traffic. In order to account for this significance, we can associate a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; with each sample based on the traffic volume it represents. Network flow data weights are always positive numbers, and they follow a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail"&gt;long tail distribution&lt;/a&gt;. These data characteristics caused MNM’s random sampling to incorrectly estimate the traffic volume of a customer’s network. Customers would see false spikes in their traffic volume analytics when an outlying data sample from the long tail was randomly selected to be the representative of all traffic at that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="400" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/5-1.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="increasing-accuracy-with-varopt-reservoir-sampling"&gt;Increasing accuracy with VarOpt reservoir sampling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, the Cloudflare engineering team implemented an alternative &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling"&gt;reservoir sampling&lt;/a&gt; technique called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0473.pdf"&gt;VarOpt&lt;/a&gt;. VarOpt is designed to collect samples from a stream of data when the length of the data stream is unknown (a perfect application for analyzing incoming network flow data). In the MNM implementation of VarOpt, we start with an empty reservoir of a fixed size that is filled with samples of network flow data. When the reservoir is full, and there is still new incoming network flow data, an old sample is randomly discarded from the reservoir and replaced with a new one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a certain number of samples have been observed, we calculate the traffic volume across all weighted samples in the reservoir, and that is the estimated traffic volume of a customer’s network flow at that point in time. Finally, the reservoir is emptied, and the VarOpt loop is restarted by filling the reservoir with the next set of the latest network flow samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new VarOpt sampling method significantly increased the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations in Magic Network Monitoring, and solved our customer’s problems. These sampling improvements paved the way for general availability, and we’re excited to make accurate network flow analytics available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="320" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/6-1.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="developer-docs-and-discord-community"&gt;Developer Docs and Discord Community&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are detailed &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;Developer Docs for Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; that explain the product’s features and outlines a step-by-step configuration guide for new customers.

And just as financial services experiences its cycles, this time of year I find myself returning to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/does-cost-reduction-play-a-role-in-digital-transformation/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;topic of cost reduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Financial services institutions are constantly challenged to strike the delicate balance between innovation and cost-saving as they seek out opportunities to decrease expenses while funding new application development projects. Historically, firms have relied on high-cost, third-party solutions to help identify savings opportunities, however, the landscape is rapidly changing, and the emergence of AI and machine learning (ML) has ushered in a new era of possibilities. These cutting-edge technologies provide lower-cost alternatives for discovering efficiencies within financial operations, all while enhancing the quality of services offered. In this dynamic environment, harnessing the power of AI and ML is proving to be a game-changer for firms seeking to thrive in an increasingly competitive market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The use cases for these technologies continue to expand and improve, shaping the industry in ways we could only dream of. In fact, some of the insights presented in this blog have been assisted by the power of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the synergy between human expertise and AI-driven insights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this year’s post, I’ve collected cost-reduction strategies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;augmented by the capabilities of generative AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and innovative approaches that promise to accelerate cost-reduction and reshape the financial services landscape in the year ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;New technology means new opportunities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;AI generally and ML, generative AI, and LLMs specifically, have the potential to significantly reduce costs for financial services at large by automating tasks, improving productivity, and reducing the need for manual labor. And by investing in these technologies, companies gain the added benefits of increasing competitive advantage and improving customer experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Although this list is not exhaustive, I’ve provided an at-a-glance aggregate of use cases for quick wins, quicker wins, and longer-term strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) and Chatbots&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Chatbots, or virtual assistants powered by generative AI, can be used to create customer-facing and employee-facing tools that assess user requests and provide personalized responses, reducing the need for human representatives and related costs. They can provide instant and accurate responses to common customer queries such as account balance, transaction history, loan information, and general banking procedures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;An EKB can be used to assist employees in accessing accurate and up-to-date product, regulatory compliance, and internal IT support information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Research and Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automate the process of gathering, analyzing, and reporting financial data and market trends, reducing the time and cost of manual research for faster decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Analyze a portfolio of investments and identify opportunities to optimize returns while managing risk. This can help investors reduce the time and cost of manual portfolio management and potentially improve investment performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Generation, Text Classification, and Clustering&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automate website content for FAQs and help sections, keeping customer-facing content up to date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automatically create personalized messages, account statements, and transaction summaries, and notify customers of upcoming events or offers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Group customers based on their transaction history, demographics, behavior patterns, and other relevant data to improve marketing and personalization outcomes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Detect patterns and indicators of potential fraudulent activities using transaction data, customer profiles, and other relevant information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quick wins!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal and Compliance&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarizing regulatory requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;AI can summarize regulatory requirements by analyzing large volumes of regulatory texts and extracting key information, making it easier for financial services firms to understand and comply with complex regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating compliance monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Analyzing and interpreting regulatory texts is time consuming, but AI can automate these tasks to help financial services firms understand and comply with complex regulations, saving time and costs associated with manual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;compliance monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing regulatory change management:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Financial services firms must stay up to date with regulatory changes by monitoring and analyzing regulatory updates. AI can enable them to quickly adapt their compliance processes and reduce the risk of non-compliance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving regulatory reporting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; AI can automate the process of generating regulatory reports, ensuring accuracy and consistency while reducing the time and effort required for manual reporting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expedited legal research:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generative AI tools can quickly search and analyze relevant case law, legislation, and secondary sources, enabling legal professionals to access pertinent information with ease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quickest wins!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Translation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilingual customer service:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;With generative AI, customer support representatives can communicate effectively with customers who may not speak the bank&amp;#8217;s primary language. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document translation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; When collaborating with multinational groups, generative AI can translate contracts, agreements, policies, and other legal/ business documents ensuring accurate written communication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Development and Testing Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code generation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;One of the benefits of generative AI is that it can be used to generate code automatically, reducing the time and effort required by developers. By analyzing existing code and patterns, generative AI algorithms can generate new code that is optimized for specific use cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Generative AI can be used to generate test cases automatically, reducing the time and effort required for developers to test their code. By analyzing the code and identifying potential edge cases, generative AI algorithms can generate test cases that cover a wide range of scenarios.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Identifying and fixing bugs in code is essential for application security. By analyzing the code and identifying potential issues, generative AI algorithms can suggest fixes that can be implemented by developers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;By analyzing the code and identifying potential optimizations, generative AI can update code automatically, improving performance and reducing resource usage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthetic data generation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generative AI can generate synthetic data for testing purposes and for training machine learning models, helping developers improve the accuracy of their models and make more informed decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated documentation generation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generating documentation is time consuming and tedious. AI can automatically generate documentation as developers write code, reducing the need for manual documentation while improving efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code comments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generative AI can be used to generate code comments that describe the function and purpose of each element of the code, helping developers identify inconsistencies or potential sources of errors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding legacy code:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Generative AI can be used to analyze and understand the structure and functionality of legacy code, making it easier for developers to work with and maintain, including:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generating unit tests:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automatically generate unit tests for legacy code, helping developers identify and fix potential issues and improve code quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code refactoring:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Assist in refactoring legacy code by suggesting improvements and identifying potential sources of bugs or inefficiencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translating legacy code to modern languages:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Translate legacy code written in outdated languages, such as COBOL, to more modern languages, making it easier to maintain and integrate with newer systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>How to Add Dark Mode in ReactJS Using Material UI</title>
      <link>https://semaphoreci.com/blog/dark-mode-reactjs-material-ui</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Material UI framework is an open-source user interface framework for React that follows the principles of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://m3.material.io/"&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s Material Design&lt;/a&gt;. It offers a variety of components allowing developers to create appealing and user-friendly interfaces, without starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Material Design prioritizes a consistent user interface with attention given to elements like light, shadow, and motion effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make our application more visually appealing we will learn how to code a Dark Mode feature for our application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can combine the Material UI framework with React to create a Dark Mode of our web applications. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of adding Dark Mode to a React application using Material UI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dark Mode, also known as night mode or darkness theme refers to an option in the user interface design where the content, on the screen is presented in colors compared to the illumination mode. When you activate the mode the background color typically appears as black or dark while the text and user interface elements are displayed in colors that create a striking contrast, between the foreground and background.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s now find out how to add Dark mode in React using Material UI (MUI).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-setting-up-a-react-project"&gt;Setting up a React Project&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we need to set up a React project first. Here&amp;#8217;s how you can get started:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-prerequisites"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you have Node.js and npm (node package manager) installed on your system before we start to implement Dark Mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-installation-of-required-dependencies"&gt;Installation of required dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To install Node.js, visit the Node.js&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/current"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, and download the current version of it according to your operating system. After that just follow the installation steps to complete the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the Node.js is installed, check whether the node.js version is properly installed by running the given command in your command line terminal:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;node –version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the Node is installed correctly, we can proceed further to add the dark mode functionality in React using MUI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-creating-a-new-react-project"&gt;Creating a new React project&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We typically create the react app using the traditional method i.e., using Create React App (CRA), but it can take a lot of time to install the required dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vite &amp;#8211; a new frontend tool that saves the time in creating a react application. So, now instead of using CRA, we are going to use Vite:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the following command in your terminal to start working with Vite:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm create vite@latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Follow the prompts to enter your project name, framework, and a variant:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;Need to install the following packages:
  create-vite@4.4.1
Ok to proceed? (y) y

✔ Project name: ... my-react-project
✔ Select a framework: » React
✔ Select a variant: » JavaScript&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, navigate to your project directory using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd my-react-project&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, use the npm command to install the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-configuring-material-ui-in-the-project"&gt;Configuring Material UI in the project&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To integrate Material UI into your React app, you need to install the Material UI core package and its styles. These come in three packages:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-start-the-development-server"&gt;Start the development server&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we will start our development server to test whether everything is properly implemented and is working.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will see the following output:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;VITE v4.4.9  ready in 943 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To see the output, visit &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:5173/&lt;/code&gt; where the default react project is running:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-21888" height="818" src="https://wpblog.semaphoreci.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f48467a316f526b2e706e67.png" width="1011" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-implement-dark-mode-using-material-ui-in-reactjs"&gt;Implement Dark Mode using Material UI in ReactJS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adding the dark mode feature in a React application involves instatiating a ThemeProvider to handle dark and light themes and adding a switch to change between modes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-enabling-dark-mode-using-material-uis-themeprovider-component"&gt;Enabling Dark Mode using Material UI&amp;#8217;s ThemeProvider component&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Material UI provides a theme provider component called ThemeProvider that will allow themes to be defined and used in the app. The ThemeProvider tool allows for a dynamic switch from light to dark themes when implementing the Dark mode. You may create two separate themes when using a Dark mode, one for Light Mode and the other for Dark Mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can use the ThemeProvider service to place components of your application into a package and switch among these themes according to user preferences or special events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To enable the dark mode, we need to create a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;darkTheme&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;createTheme&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;utility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For applying the dark theme to entire application, we will wrap all our main content into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;component, ensuring that all components within it follow the defined theme, creating a consistent and visually appealing user interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now go to the &lt;code&gt;src/App.js&lt;/code&gt; file in your project and replace the existing code of the file with the following example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;// App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";

import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";

export default function App() {

  // create a darkTheme function to handle dark theme using createTheme
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      mode: darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light',
    },
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
	// other code goes here…
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code, apart from using just the ThemeProvider, we also use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;CssBaseline&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to use the full set of Global CSS Styles in your applications. The inclusion of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;CssBaseline&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is required for ensuring coherent image experience in both light as well as darkness modes when implementing this mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once, you are done with the above step, you can now create a separate dark theme with different colors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-creating-a-separate-dark-theme"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a separate dark theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To customize the dark theme for multiple components in the application, you can modify it by defining the primary, and secondary colors and other properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Replace the existing palette colors with the following example code in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;after the imports and before&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;export default function App()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js

export default function App() {

// applying the primary and secondary theme colors
const darkTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: 'dark', //default theme
    primary: {
      main: '#90caf9',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#f48fb1',
    },
   // add other properties here…
  },
});

  ...

  return(
    ...
  )

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the complete&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;setup, your entire app will now use the dark theme by default. But what if we want to toggle between light and dark themes? We will do it next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-toggling-dark-mode"&gt;Toggling Dark Mode&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To give your users a way to toggle between different theme modes, you can add React&amp;#8217;s context to a button&amp;#8217;s onChange event, as shown in the following demo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-creating-a-switch-or-button-to-toggle-between-light-and-dark-mode"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a switch or button to toggle between light and dark mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To toggle between the light and dark modes in a React app, we need to add a switch button to it. Adding a switch can be done by importing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;Component from Material UI and then defining it in the App component.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For defining a switch, we can simply add the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;component between the ThemeProvider tags. We&amp;#8217;re going to add a div, a card with example content and the switch to change the theme:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js 

export default function App() {

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    ...
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;

        //Adding the switch button
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={darkMode} onChange={toggleSwitchFunction} /&gt;
         ...
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you have added the Switch button, let’s define the toggle states so that the switch can toggle the dark or light theme. Below is how we can define the states using the &lt;code&gt;useState()&lt;/code&gt; hook in React.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js 

export default function App() {

  // state to manage the dark mode
  const [toggleDarkMode, setToggleDarkMode] = useState(true);

  // function to toggle the dark mode as true or false
  const toggleDarkTheme = () =&gt; {
    setToggleDarkMode(!toggleDarkMode);
  };

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    ...
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&gt;Toggle Dark mode&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={toggleDarkMode} onChange={toggleDarkTheme} /&gt;
         ...
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we have first imported all the required components from React and MUI, after which inside the main App component, we have initialized a state variable&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;toggleDarkMode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;where the initial value is set to true, indicating the dark theme is currently active. With the variable, we have also defined a function to update the state called&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;setToggleDarkMode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will add our card example to switch the theme and if you have followed all the steps correctly your App.js should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js file

import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";
import { Card, CardContent, CardMedia, Switch, Typography } from "@mui/material"

export default function App() {

  // state to manage the dark mode
  const [toggleDarkMode, setToggleDarkMode] = useState(true);

  // function to toggle the dark mode as true or false
  const toggleDarkTheme = () =&gt; {
    setToggleDarkMode(!toggleDarkMode);
  };

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      mode: 'light',
      primary: {
        main: '#90caf9',
      },
      secondary: {
        main: '#131052',
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&gt;Toggle Dark mode&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={toggleDarkMode} onChange={toggleDarkTheme} /&gt;
        &amp;lt;Card sx={{ width: '30%', borderRadius: 3, padding: 1 }}&gt;
          &amp;lt;CardContent&gt;
            &amp;lt;CardMedia sx={{ height: 180, borderRadius: 3 }} image="https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg" title="semaphore" /&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="h4" component="div" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}&gt;
              Programming Blogs
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }} color="text.secondary"&gt;
              by Semaphore
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="body1"&gt;
              Checkout the latest blogs on Semaphore. Semaphore provides you the best CI/CD solution
              for high-performance engineering teams.
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
          &amp;lt;/CardContent&gt;
        &amp;lt;/Card&gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you run the above code, you will notice that the toggle doesn’t change the theme to dark or light, as we haven’t added the state to update the theme dynamically, it will display a light theme by default.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we will see how we can handle the state of the dark mode toggle and update it dynamically by toggling the switch button based on the dark mode state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-handling-the-state-of-the-dark-mode-toggle-updating-the-theme-dynamically-based-on-the-dark-mode-state"&gt;Handling the state of the Dark Mode toggle, updating the theme dynamically based on the Dark Mode state&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You noticed that when we switch on the button, it doesn’t change the theme, it is because the state is not being handled to update the theme dynamically. We now see how we can update the theme dynamically based on the dark mode state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To switch the theme dynamically, we are going to render a conditional condition in the &lt;code&gt;darkTheme&lt;/code&gt; mode within our App.js file as given below:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;const darkTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: toggleDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light', 
    ...
  },
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, If you have followed all the steps correctly, your App.js will finally look like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";
import { Card, CardContent, CardMedia, Switch, Typography } from "@mui/material"

export default function App() {

  // state to manage the dark mode
  const [toggleDarkMode, setToggleDarkMode] = useState(true);

  // function to toggle the dark mode as true or false
  const toggleDarkTheme = () =&gt; {
    setToggleDarkMode(!toggleDarkMode);
  };

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {

      secondary: {
        main: '#131052',

      },
    },
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;

}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the given code, we have used conditional rendering in the palette mode to dynamically update the dark mode theme in React. We have assigned the value of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;toggleDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light'&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;property which indicates that when&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;toggleDarkMode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is true, the theme&amp;#8217;s mode is set to &amp;#8216;dark&amp;#8217;, else it will be set to &amp;#8216;light&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-run-the-application"&gt;Run the application&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we have successfully learned how we can add the dark mode functionality in React using Material UI, let’s see the output of the above program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To run the application of react, in your terminal run the below command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Go to localhost:port, and see the output. The output of the given code will look like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-21889" height="520" src="https://wpblog.semaphoreci.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f71524f437161352e706e67.gif" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s all folks! Now, you have successfully learned the complete process to add dark mode in React using Material UI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you&amp;#8217;ve gained an understanding of how to add dark mode into React using Material UI. By integrating a dark theme you can enhance the user experience by providing an appealing and eye-friendly alternative theme.&lt;/p&gt;

**总结：**
本文介绍了在游戏开发中与软件咨询公司建立合作伙伴关系的潜力。通过合作伙伴关系能够加速项目的推进并提供多样化的技能和服务。软件咨询公司不仅能够帮助开发团队加快上市时间，还能通过协作优势提高生产力。他们的技能包括快速开发和部署用户生成内容平台、伴随应用和门户、游戏用户界面和企业设计系统、用户体验设计、人工智能驱动的分析和个性化以及战略化的盈利与用户激励等方面。通过与合适的软件咨询公司合作，可以最大限度地发挥游戏的潜力并取得成功。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a decision-maker on a game development team, you&amp;#8217;re no stranger to the ever-changing dynamics of the gaming industry. Here, time-to-market is not just a catchphrase but a critical metric. The constant demand for new and engaging content means game developers, large and small, often face immense pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve probably engaged with traditional industry partnerships. But, have you ever considered teaming up with a software consultancy as your g&lt;span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"&gt;ame co-development partner? It might be time you did, and here&amp;#8217;s why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case Study: Pixelberry Studios and Atomic Object&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year and a half, I&amp;#8217;ve been immersed in an exciting project, bringing my skills as a software designer to a collaborative effort between Atomic Object and Pixelberry. (&lt;a href="https://atomicobject.com/portfolio/pixelberry-digital-storytelling-platform"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can read more about the project here!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) Pixelberry looked beyond the usual suspects for partners and came to Atomic Object, a software consultancy. Theirs was a large ask — create an immersive User Generated Content Platform from the ground up. We helped them deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our parent company gave us one year and asked us if we could go big,” said David Robinson, Director of Production at StoryLoom. “We asked the Atomic team, ‘We want to go big — can you go on this journey with us?’ and they said, ‘Yeah, we’ll get on that ship with you!’ They didn’t flinch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a dynamic team comprising fellow design and software consultants from Atomic Object and key stakeholders at Pixelberry, we poured our collective knowledge and passion into crafting &lt;a href="https://storyloom.com/"&gt;StoryLoom,&lt;/a&gt; a cross-platform experience for mobile and desktop where the community can play, build, and publish interactive story games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixelberry and Atomic collaborated throughout the g&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ame development pipeline. Using Figma and focusing on value-driven, lean UX, we embarked on designing an enterprise-level design system and applied it to create an end-to-end user experience. From creating a cross-platform architecture to building custom content authoring tools for interactive story publishing, we delivered beyond the role of traditional software development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was completed on time and budget, delivering a feature-rich, engaging platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They are laser-focused on budget and timing, which is something I&amp;#8217;ve never seen in 30 years of development,&amp;#8221; said David Robinson. &amp;#8220;It was delivered on time, on budget, to expectation, live—not three or four milestones late with people leaving and the platform half-baked and full of bugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome included an innovative set of creator tools within the &lt;a href="https://storyloom.com/"&gt;StoryLoom&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem, including a user-friendly, no-code story builder, a dynamic character creator, a creator economy, and a custom admin experience. The most rewarding moment was when we finally reached our goal together and launched an open beta for the storytelling community in just 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience has led me to think more about how software and game companies might team up to produce innovative products. This is not because it&amp;#8217;s my job, but because I have a passion for games and would genuinely love to see more projects in this intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software Consultancies: Empower Your Gaming Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a reason Pixelberry chose to partner with Atomic to create a proof of concept, and eventually ship a cross-platform application for web and mobile. Here are some advantages I believe software companies like Atomic bring to the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#8217;re very versatile!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software consultancy is not just a dev shop. We&amp;#8217;re extensions of your team and bring &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/08/22/generalist-makers-the-unicorns-of-the-software-industry/"&gt;diverse services and experiences&lt;/a&gt; to the table. &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/tag/generalist-makers/"&gt;Generalist makers&lt;/a&gt; have a wide range of skills, from &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/07/18/mobile-phone-statistics/"&gt;product strategy&lt;/a&gt; and UX Design to API integrations and analytics. One of our key strengths is that we bring best practices and lessons learned from other sectors like healthcare and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We can help accelerate your go-to-market strategy.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/08/04/sprint-planning/"&gt;agile methodologies&lt;/a&gt;, consultancies can help streamline your roadmap and processes. From the first idea to beta, and even after the big launch, a high-performing, dedicated team can be essential. They&amp;#8217;ll help you move and scale fast without missing important milestones along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#8217;re pros at collaboration.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software consultants can effortlessly blend into your existing setup. Whether you need them to &lt;a href="https://atomicobject.com/client-resources/select-software-development-partner"&gt;lead or simply supplement your team&lt;/a&gt;, their contribution will level up your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3656846" height="1080" src="https://spin.atomicobject.com/wp-content/uploads/3.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Software Consultancies Offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most software consultancies don&amp;#8217;t specialize in game production for game engines like Unity, our teams share much of the same development skills. We&amp;#8217;re also both versed in designing and engineering services like those that support gameplay and the larger player experience.&lt;br /&gt;
User-Generated Content Platforms &amp;#8211; Skill sets in JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular translate to rapid development and deployment of UGC platforms. This can supercharge co-creation and community engagement, and incentivize players to create value in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companion Apps and Portals&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you envision your game sharing real-time data with a companion app? &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/08/28/server-sent-events/"&gt;Modern APIs and WebSocket technology&lt;/a&gt; can make this a reality. Using these tools, you can offer players a seamless experience, from in-game to secondary screens. Create a more immersive experience by enabling player personalization and customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game UI and Enterprise Design Systems&lt;/strong&gt;. A cohesive design language across platforms is more than eye candy. It’s essential for brand continuity, and this is where software designers excel. Implementing flexible and scalable &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/11/23/figma-reusable-complex-components/"&gt;design systems&lt;/a&gt; encourages a consistent look and feel across complex game ecosystems. Implementing reusable &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/06/22/reusable-react-components/"&gt;components&lt;/a&gt;, modules, and &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/07/19/typescript-federated-modules/"&gt;microfrontends&lt;/a&gt; helps create an easily scalable foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Experience (UX) Design&lt;/strong&gt;. Software designers are adept at crafting user-centric experiences. Leveraging insights from user research and analytics, like methods used in Player Experience (PX) Design, they can help fine-tune in-game interactions to optimize enjoyment, engagement, and retention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Powered Analytics and Personalization&lt;/strong&gt;. Integration of machine learning can elevate your game by introducing features like predictive analytics and personalized player experiences. Software consultants experienced in AI integrations can identify new opportunities for increasing player engagement, player retention, or &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;average revenue per user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Monetization and User Incentives&lt;/strong&gt;. A software consultancy&amp;#8217;s expertise isn&amp;#8217;t limited to development and design. They can also construct secure, transparent in-game economies and strategies to incentivize player engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting a partner to co-develop your game or app is an enduring commitment. And, in a world where game companies are constantly racing against the clock, augmentation through a strategic team partnership can be your game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3656845" height="1080" src="https://spin.atomicobject.com/wp-content/uploads/2-1.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is knowing if you&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="https://atomicobject.com/client-resources/choosing-the-right-software-development-partner"&gt;choosing the right partner&lt;/a&gt;. You don&amp;#8217;t just need more people. Instead, you need the right people who can go beyond traditional roles to deliver results and truly augment your own capabilities. A software consultancy can be your unexplored avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t limit your scope. Consider software consultancies like Atomic Object in your &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/06/17/software-partner-estimations/"&gt;selection process&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#8217;ll get more than just additional hands; you gain strategic partners committed to your game&amp;#8217;s success. Let&amp;#8217;s unlock your game&amp;#8217;s full potential, together.&lt;/p&gt;

**大纲：**
- 聊天GPT、Copilot和Codex等工具的介绍和应用。

- 在技术面试中评估使用这些工具的候选人的方法和问题。
- 没有解决面试中使用工具的问题对候选人和公司带来的影响。
- 未来的技术面试趋势和对面试过程的改进。

**总结：**
本文讨论了在聊天GPT、Copilot、Codex等工具的流行和广泛应用下，如何在技术面试中评估候选人使用这些工具的能力。未解决这个问题可能导致无法评估候选人的真正能力，从而影响招聘的质量。文章提出了评估使用这些工具的候选人的方法，并展望了未来技术面试的发展趋势。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FcHc33-5Mg3PjxFoxtOtsw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image generated by using the title of this article&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of ChatGPT, Copilot, Codex, and other tools makes it easier to code but also makes it easier to answer live coding interviews unless we do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OLX, we promote the use of a tool called &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110901049833439234?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7110901049833439234%29"&gt;PlusOne&lt;/a&gt;, which is an internal LLM tool made to help us code, coach ourselves, and more. This reveals an interesting gap, which is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If OLX promotes the use of a tool once you are hired, why when hiring are we not evaluating people based on using these tools effectively?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of not addressing this is that people who can’t adapt to the use of these tools will surely lag behind other engineers, and their performance will suffer. We will only be able to notice this after a few months, and it is better to notice that as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those who are not aware: ChatGPT is a Large Language Model able to generate code if you give it a problem statement and the platform+language it should use. Copilot is a tool from Github that can autocomplete large amounts of code, e.g. writing unit tests. Codex is a similar LLM tool from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we saw two interview candidates using Copilot/Codex during a live coding interview. While we talked about the possibility of that happening during our interviewer's sync, we were not really prepared to evaluate candidates if they use those, compared to candidates who don’t use them. Because of this, I was interested to know the latest on the:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allowing the usage of Copilot/LLMs during live coding interviews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case of allowing it, evaluating candidates that use them during the interview&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the case of not allowing it, evaluating if they know how to use these tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will be exploring what happens if we don’t act on this, what can be done to adjust to the new normal, and what is the view of the future in tech interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Related Work&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other articles discussed this topic. This &lt;a href="https://blog.expertlead.com/how-ai-driven-chatbots-like-chatgpt-are-affecting-the-way-of-doing-tech-assessments"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; talks about the critical thinking and creativity skills that cannot be taken away by the AI tools that are provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dawn-ai-coding-rethinking-engineering-interview-vidal-graupera/"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; article, Vidal talks about how soft skills become more important in the light of these tools that help with generating code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pair+programming+with+llm&amp;amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enDE996DE996&amp;amp;oq=pair+programming+with+llm&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgcIAhAAGKIE0gEIMzU0OWowajSoAgCwAgA&amp;amp;hl=en-GB&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; on how to pair program with a LLM was published in collaboration with Google. This shows some basics of how to use a LLM while writing code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not addressing what to do on this topic will lead to a couple of scenarios&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Candidates will not be able to show their full potential during interviews when we don’t allow them to use the Copilot that they are used to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will get candidates who we are not sure if they can’t learn to work with these tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We get less time evaluating their critical thinking skills due to setting up code, downloading dependencies, or a slow machine, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will not be able to find candidates who work very well with these tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These all impact the quality of hires by decreasing success rates for people who cannot use LLM tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of not allowing these tools. We are going to be falling back into the age of interviews before these tools existed. People rely on their own problem-solving skills, and the amount of output they generate during live coding interviews is limited by their machine’s speed in compilation and their ability to debug quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case we allow the copilot tools, there would be less effort in generating the initial code to allow developers to start quickly. There are multiple cases that could happen based on how good the Copilot/LLM tools they use are, in decreasing order of help from the Copilot/LLM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They don’t have access to these tools. In this case, we fall back to classical interviewing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Copilot generates the whole solution for them, with no need to edit/debug, and it already covers the edge cases we would be throwing at them. We would only be able to evaluate their prompt engineering skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Copilot generates code that works for the normal cases and is missing edge cases. We would be able to evaluate their prompt engineering skills, their code review skills, their ability to identify edge cases, and their ability to adapt the code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Copilot generates a barely working code that doesn’t meet the requirements. They would have to correct the LLM to guide it to a working solution like the case above. Or they would have to break down the problem so that the tool can help them with some parts of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cases reveal some of the (new) key concepts that we need to pay attention to when evaluating candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting of technical coding interview from pure code generation to prompt engineering plus code review plus refactoring (of course, also debugging and testing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. they would write the problem in a form that LLM understands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Review&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. to find edge cases and see if the code works as intended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. changing the architecture of the generated code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. if the generated code doesn’t work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. to confirm that the generated code works in various cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to assess the seniority of the person using these key concepts, we also have to benchmark what a junior vs mid vs senior interviewee would look like. For example, a Senior Engineer would be able to identify more edge cases or would be able to explain the engineering choices that the tool made and maybe explain what happens to these decisions if the assumptions change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View of the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Coding interviews are a way to test how someone would perform in a real-life situation in a short amount of time using a controlled environment. Some tradeoffs in this process are the amount of time and the accuracy and granularity of evaluation that we are able to make during this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by a &lt;a href="https://www.offerzen.com/events/offerzen-events/untold-stories-in-tech-hiring/do-more-with-less-futureproof-technical-assessments-with-ai"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; I heard before that mentions that, ideally, we would also include working together with the team to evaluate a real-life situation where people are working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the interview process would involve people from the team and a Copilot-like tool, which mirrors how a normal working day looks like. The problem with this approach is that it uses a lot of time from the interviewers. In the current view of things, we already have this problem of Engineers spending a lot of time on interviews, which is mitigated by limiting the time per week that is allocated to this. We also treat interviewing as part of Senior Engineer responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While using LLMs won’t replace our technical skills, it will definitely add to our suite of second-brain tools like Google Search, Stackoverflow, or our own notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there will still be some time until companies adapt to allowing these tools or being able to evaluate people who use these AI tools during live coding interviews. The call to action is for us to start talking about how to evaluate them. Otherwise, we won’t be able to have people who can’t work with these tools and will be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be diving deeper into this topic and how to transition from the classical technical interview process in another article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=4e09553bb117" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tech.olx.com/live-coding-interviews-in-the-era-of-llms-4e09553bb117"&gt;Live Coding Interviews in the Era of LLMs&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://tech.olx.com"&gt;OLX Engineering&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.hostinger.com/blog/ai-website-builder-unique-websites</link>
      <description>**关键词：**
- AI-powered Hostinger Website Builder（AI技术驱动的Hostinger网站构建工具）
- unique website（独特的网站）
- AI engine（AI引擎）
- AI tools（AI工具）
- Hostinger Website Builder（Hostinger网站构建工具）

**大纲：**
1. AI技术驱动的Hostinger网站构建工具能够根据用户提供的简短描述自动生成独特的网站。
2. 新的AI引擎保证了每个网站都是独一无二的，并且设计和内容能够适应网站的性质。
3. AI生成网站的过程非常简单快捷，只需要四个步骤即可完成。
4. 新的AI引擎相比之前的版本有以下优势：提供更多样化的网站布局选择、同一网站类型可以适应更多的用例、生成的网站更为完整。
5. Hostinger网站构建工具还提供其他AI工具，如AI Writer、AI Heatmap和AI Logo Maker，以帮助用户更轻松高效地进行网站开发。

**总结：**
Hostinger提供的AI技术驱动的网站构建工具能够根据简短描述自动生成独特的网站，用户只需点击几下即可完成整个过程。新的AI引擎确保每个网站都是独一无二的，并且提供更多样化的布局选择和更完整的页面内容。此外，Hostinger还提供其他AI工具，如AI Writer、AI Heatmap和AI Logo Maker，以帮助用户轻松实现网站开发。使用Hostinger网站构建工具，用户不需要编码或网页设计技能，而且还可以享受免费域名、电子邮件等特点，以确保在线业务的安全性和性能。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;You only need a name, a website type, and a short description to get a website with&lt;strong&gt; AI-powered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/website-builder" rel="follow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hostinger Website Builder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent update ensures that every website AI generates is unique and that the design and content fit the nature of the site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The website creation process remains the same and takes only four clicks. After choosing the &lt;strong&gt;AI Website Builder&lt;/strong&gt;, you just need to describe your business or project.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Website creation with AI Website Builder" class="wp-image-5649" height="613" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/websitebuilder-aibuilder-1024x613.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The AI will automatically prepare the page structure, layout, and mobile view. Then, it will generate your unique content, choose relevant pictures, and perform other technical tasks. While this might sound complicated, &lt;strong&gt;your unique website will be ready in less than a minute&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are unhappy with it, return to the AI form by clicking the corresponding button on the page&amp;#8217;s top-left corner. Refine your request, or don’t even change anything – the newly generated site will still differ from the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Websites generated with Hostinger AI Website Builder." class="wp-image-5650" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/aiwebsitebuilder-generated-websites-1024x683.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once satisfied with the result, personalize the site to your liking. Enter the Full edit mode for complete customization. &lt;strong&gt;Change colors and fonts, drag and drop page elements, add, remove, or switch sections, and make other adjustments&lt;/strong&gt; to get the website you want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-advantages-of-the-new-ai-engine"&gt;Advantages of the New AI Engine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our earlier AI integration used several predefined templates and added relevant content to them. In some cases, websites were very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new AI engine generates a sitemap of website pages and their sections. It then injects a suitable variation for each of the sections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;AI uses the same framework to create a new, unique website&lt;/strong&gt; for every request it gets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This way, every blog, online portfolio, or business showcase generated by AI differs. The advantages are threefold:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger variety of site layouts&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re also working on more design options to expand the choice even further.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The same website type can cover more use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; With a Business showcase type, a restaurant website can now have a separate menu section, and a personal coach site can include an appointment section.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Websites are much more complete. &lt;/strong&gt;The relevant pages are generated based on the initial description, and additional ones can be added anytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-ai-tools-in-hostinger-website-builder"&gt;More AI Tools in Hostinger Website Builder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI builder is one of several &lt;strong&gt;AI tools&lt;/strong&gt; in Hostinger Website Builder. Here’s how AI can make web development easier and more efficient:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Writer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Describe your idea, and get unique, compelling, and SEO-friendly content. It can generate any kind of content, including blog posts, pages, or even product descriptions, to boost your SEO performance and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Heatmap&lt;/strong&gt;. Analyze your website’s design and structure to predict user behavior. By using the heatmap, you can adjust the layout, font sizes, images, buttons, and other design elements so that visitors notice exactly what you want to show them first.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Logo Maker&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Upscale your visual identity with a captivating logo. Share your brand name and slogan, describe your ideal logo, and choose a design from the AI-generated options. Just a few clicks, and you can start using your new logo everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-hostinger-website-builder-benefits"&gt;Other Hostinger Website Builder Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best part of using Hostinger Website Builder is that you &lt;strong&gt;don’t need coding or web design skills&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone can create a website, including a business site, a portfolio, or an online store.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more experienced users with specific preferences, get started with one of &lt;strong&gt;150 designer-tailored templates&lt;/strong&gt; and make your website stand out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell online&lt;/strong&gt; without additional transaction fees and optimize campaigns with &lt;strong&gt;integrated marketing tools&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Create and edit websites with your smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s all included. With the &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/website-builder" rel="follow"&gt;Website Builder &amp;amp; Web Hosting&lt;/a&gt; plan, you also get a &lt;strong&gt;free domain, emails, up to 100 websites, &lt;/strong&gt;and dozens of tools and features to ensure the &lt;strong&gt;security and performance&lt;/strong&gt; of your online business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CodeSOD: Write, Write Again</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/write-write-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melissa&lt;/strong&gt; was trying to figure out why an old application wasn't writing out a data file when commanded to do so. It was an implemented feature, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work, it &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; worked at one point- but it wasn't working now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She traced through the C code and found this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-c"&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="hljs-title function_"&gt;writeconf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-params"&gt;(&lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
{
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; fd;
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; buf[&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;];
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; len;
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; loop;

    &lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;snprintf&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;amp;buf[&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;(buf),&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"%d\n"&lt;/span&gt;, confval);
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(loop=&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; loop&amp;lt;&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;; loop++)    &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;//try 10 times to open file&lt;/span&gt;
    {
        fd=open(&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"/tmp/conf"&lt;/span&gt;, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT);
        &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(fd != &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;)
        {
            len=write(fd, &amp;amp;buf[&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;strlen&lt;/span&gt;(buf));
            close(fd);
            &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;  &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;//Ok, ready to exit&lt;/span&gt;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this code is to write a single integer out to &lt;code&gt;/tmp/conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first, we use &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; to write that integer out to a buffer. This line alone piles on the WTFs. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;buf[0]&lt;/code&gt; isn't &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, but it's &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. Arrays in C are pointers to the first object in the array. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;buf[0]&lt;/code&gt; returns a pointer to the first object in the array. &lt;em&gt;They're the same thing&lt;/em&gt;. I don't understand why they went the long way around, unless they didn't understand what arrays are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; doesn't need to be 100 characters long, but that's a minor thing. But the real "yikes" is &lt;code&gt;confval&lt;/code&gt; itself- a global variable accessed from inside this function, which hints at many, many other bad choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we loop. We try to open the file up to ten times. If we fail, we just try again. No waiting, no timeouts, just.. try it ten times, as quick as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we open it, we write the data, again using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;buf[0]&lt;/code&gt; idiom. And… do nothing to check that we successfully wrote anything out. We just hope for the best, close the file descriptor, and exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn't answer &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the file wasn't getting written, but it definitely explained why no one was seeing errors. This doesn't do any meaningful error handling. If it can't open the file, it just gives up after ten tries. If it can't write to the file, it doesn't notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: Seriously though, is there some good reason for `&amp;buf[0]` that I don't know about? It seems so intentional, but it makes no sense, and yes, I double checked the spec to make sure there wasn't a gotcha in there that I wasn't thinking about (but only skimmed the section on the subscripting rules, so maybe there's something else out there? MAKE IT MAKE SENSE) --&gt;

      <title>New short story: “Professional Integrity”</title>
      <link>https://blog.rinesi.com/2023/10/new-short-story-professional-integrity/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of your coworkers seem to look forward to the mandatory therapy sessions. You wonder what they talk about with the AI therapist, most often as your session approaches and you have to decide what parts of the truth you&amp;#8217;ll let yourself talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can talk about anything you want. Interactions in a therapy context aren&amp;#8217;t available to your managers and are only used in an anonymized way to monitor the overall health of the company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s only a program. You could ask it if it feels embarrassed for saying something as ridiculous as &amp;#8220;in an anonymized way&amp;#8221;, but it&amp;#8217;d only use that as another input in its modeling. It&amp;#8217;s as incapable of feeling that type of shame as your car software or somebody in marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, you are fairly sure the company and the implant&amp;#8217;s maker lie about the device in your brain not working as a lie detector and the implant happens to be the main thing you don&amp;#8217;t want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&amp;#8217;d feel better if you hadn&amp;#8217;t done therapy before entering the company. You have to, now  &amp;mdash; an FDA requirement for anybody with a cognitively interfaced brain implant &amp;mdash; and restricted to the company&amp;#8217;s own AI &amp;mdash; too many secrets in your head, operational and otherwise; some of them you even know yourself. A good therapy AI, goes the theory, would be able to glean aspects of the implant&amp;#8217;s software based on your response patterns as easily as it can model the rest of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As easily as it can model &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt; Easy mistake to make even in the privacy of your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s private. Your contract says so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You seem anxious lately. What&amp;#8217;s on your mind?&lt;/i&gt; (You want to laugh at the phrasing, don&amp;#8217;t, think the implant registered the intent anyway and informed the AI.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Actaeon deadlines, mostly. It&amp;#8217;s an important project and I know how much it matters to the company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image of a man rendered on your screen nods. &lt;i&gt;Sleep problems aren&amp;#8217;t uncommon in this sort of situation. Have you been sleeping well?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist knows to the minute how much you&amp;#8217;ve been sleeping and when. Better than you know, unless you really haven&amp;#8217;t slept more than an hour or two a day for the last few months. You wouldn&amp;#8217;t put it past the implant&amp;#8217;s capabilities to keep you functional in that situation if not for the fact that if they could do that then it&amp;#8217;d be everybody&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reply that you think you&amp;#8217;ve been sleeping the usual four hours. You used to need six before the implant. Another thing you both know and neither one says aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image nods again and the session ends soon afterward. You are happy to go back to work. You aren&amp;#8217;t always. &lt;i&gt;Motivated,&lt;/i&gt; yes. You haven&amp;#8217;t had once to push yourself to start working ever since you entered the company and got the implant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the company and the implant and everything else you had already done mandatory (read: your father told you to) therapy with a designated therapist (read: the one your father chose and paid for) to address what she ended up describing as episodes of loss of emotional control stemming from environmental stress. &amp;#8220;Environmental stress&amp;#8221; was an euphemism and loss of emotional control was something you were already familiar with &amp;ndash; but until then you had never thought about what it was that you were failing to control. It turned out that minds could have desires they themselves didn&amp;#8217;t know about. It wasn&amp;#8217;t a moral failure but a fact of neural architecture. Everybody had a subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist didn&amp;#8217;t think dreams were a good window into the subconscious. &lt;i&gt;You are who you are in everything you do. Don&amp;#8217;t worry about decrypting your dreams. Look at what you do. What things are you doing you don&amp;#8217;t know you are doing?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stopped working with her a few years before entering the company. If you could, you would tell her that your dreams have changed since you got the implant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t get a brain scan except in a company-approved clinic. The implant connects to a separate wireless network inside the office and enters a pseudo-Faraday cage mode when you leave. Those aren&amp;#8217;t the only safety measures: the Security department considers external infiltration a serious issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There&amp;#8217;s still a tiny scar on the back of your head where they inserted the implant&amp;#8217;s main mesh and left a small access panel for the annual hardware upgrades.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security hasn&amp;#8217;t forbidden trying to learn about the implant by introspection and self-observation, as if it were a compulsion or trauma. It probably means it&amp;#8217;s useless. You try anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everybody else they hire, you were very good before entering the company and much better afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have more focus. Less of a social life, not that you really had one. You no longer stress about the societal negative externalities of your work. No nightmares about dead children. A great salary. The indescribable feeling of being so good at what you do you don&amp;#8217;t remember the last time you made a mistake or stood still confused about the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI never asks you if you think about quitting. It&amp;#8217;s not that they don&amp;#8217;t want to put the idea in your head. They know you won&amp;#8217;t. You know you won&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s not even the implant,&lt;/i&gt; you think sometimes. The thought makes you feel ill in a different way, but at least you&amp;#8217;re almost sure it&amp;#8217;s yours.&lt;/p&gt;

**总结：**

该文章介绍了在Web上切换浅色和深色主题的几种方式。可以使用JavaScript或prefers-color-scheme媒体查询根据用户系统偏好切换主题。另外，CSS引入了新的light-dark函数，可以更方便地实现无缝切换，并且可以根据不同属性指定不同的属性值。此外，color-scheme属性可以扩展light-dark函数的使用范围。目前，light-dark函数在Firefox 120中得到支持，希望其他浏览器也会很快支持该功能。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have many ways to switch between light and dark themes on the web. We can use JavaScript to switch between themes or we can use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; media query in CSS to switch between themes based on the user’s system preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="markdown-toc"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/the-new-light-dark-function-to-switch-theme-color-in-css/#the-new-light-dark-function" id="markdown-toc-the-new-light-dark-function"&gt;The new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/the-new-light-dark-function-to-switch-theme-color-in-css/#browser-support" id="markdown-toc-browser-support"&gt;Browser support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; media query lets us do things that would only be applied when light or dark mode is enabled on the user’s system. For instance, you can change the background color of the page to black when the user has enabled dark mode on their system like so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also change the color of the text based on the user’s system preference the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-new-light-dark-function"&gt;The new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to make this all more seamless, CSS is getting &lt;a href="https://www.bram.us/2023/10/09/the-future-of-css-easy-light-dark-mode-color-switching-with-light-dark/"&gt;a new function called&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; which will let you specify two values for a property. The first value will be applied when the user has enabled light mode on their system and the second value will be applied when the user has enabled dark mode on their system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, we don’t need to use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; media query anymore. The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function will take care of that for us. And it’s also more granular as you can specify different values for different properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the user’s theme preference, the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function can also be used to switch between two values based on the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme"&gt;CSS property&lt;/a&gt; allows an element to indicate which color schemes it can comfortably be rendered in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means, for &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; to work, you must also include a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;--text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* In Light Mode = return 1st value. 
  In Dark Mode = return 2nd value. */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; property on a specific element so that it only applies to that element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="browser-support"&gt;Browser support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for browser support, the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function is currently supported in Firefox 120 but hopefully, it will be supported in other browsers soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function on its specification page &lt;a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#light-dark"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Joy at Work: How Galwegians Chart Their Professional Destinies</title>
      <link>https://galois.com/blog/2023/10/joy-at-work-how-galwegians-chart-their-professional-destinies/</link>
      <description>**关键词**: Galois，求职，“joy at work”，自我导向，职业发展 

**大纲**:
- “Joy at Work”的核心原则：工作应该是一种深度满足和有意义的来源，我们可以自由地将我们的技能和才能提供给Galois，为Galois和自己共同获益。
- Galois如何促进“joy at work”：允许员工根据自己的兴趣和喜好灵活地指导自己的职业发展，鼓励员工在公司内部转岗发展。
- 根据员工的技能和兴趣与公司的需求进行职业转型。
- 作者的个人经历：从兼职顾问到高级财务分析师的职业发展，展示了自我导向职业发展的案例。
- Galois的核心信念：个人的快乐和专业的成功并不是互斥的，而是相互交织的因素，对于一个有意义的工作经验至关重要。

**总结**:
本文介绍了Galois公司追求“joy at work”的核心原则和实践方法，鼓励员工在工作中追求个人的满足和快乐，并允许他们根据自己的兴趣和能力来自我导向地发展职业。通过作者的个人经历，展示了如何在Galois内部实现职业转型和发展。Galois坚信个人的快乐和专业的成功是相辅相成的，为员工提供了一个充满意义和成就感的工作环境。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of Galois’s core principles is “Seek joy at work.” While that may sound a little fuzzy, we define this principle as follows: “Work should be a source of deep satisfaction and meaning, a place where we can freely offer our skills and talents to the mutual benefit of Galois and ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest ways Galois fosters “joy at work” involves giving Galwegians the ability to chart their own professional destiny—flexibly steering the direction of their career based on their interests and the kinds of tasks that give them joy. Machine learning specialists have learned formal methods and changed the kind of work they do; Research Engineers have discovered a love for project management and become Project Leads; even our General Counsel started out as the front desk manager! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this sort of career transition isn’t done on a whim. To change tacks, a Galwegian’s skills and interests have to match up with an unmet need within the company. But within those parameters, Galois builds from our “joy at work” principle to allow for a remarkable amount of self-direction when it comes to growing and evolving one’s career.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My own story is a great example of what this can look like in action. Over my 15 years at Galois, I went from a part-time consultant to senior financial analyst.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My journey looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where I started:&lt;/strong&gt; Independent Consultant&lt;strong&gt; →&lt;/strong&gt; Part-Time Employee&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, Galois hired me as an independent consultant. Within a year, their contracts department realized they needed help. I had the skill sets they needed and the desire to do the work, so I was hired on as a part-time employee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution round 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Part-Time → Full-Time&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back then, the company was still relatively small, with about a quarter of the employees we have now. Still, there were a lot of operational hats to wear without enough heads to wear them. Since I was already working at Galois part-time, and had already built trust and relationships, it was an easy transition for me to put on a few of those hats that suited me: general office management, continued contracts support, assistance with proposals and costing efforts, and lightweight accounting support. As duties were added, I transitioned from part-time Contract Specialist to full-time Office Coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution round 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Office Coordinator → Offer Building / Proposals Operations&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the company grew, so did the needs in our offer building (the term we use for sales) group, specifically around proposals and forecasting. Since I was already working in and enjoying these tasks as a sub-set of my job, I decided to pursue Proposals Operations as my full time work. This is where I spent the bulk of my years at Galois, working alongside an amazing team of business development experts, principal scientists, and researchers, and having a blast doing it!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution round 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Offer Building / Proposals Operations → Financial Analyst&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After spending a few years in the offer building arena, with the added support for engineering and finance, I’d been exposed to a wide range of overall company operations. It felt like a good time for me to make a shift, and a need was emerging in finance to have a dedicated financial analyst, which perfectly aligned with my career goals. Another win/win!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, my career evolved with my interests and Galois’s needs. When I wanted to try a new and interesting career direction, I didn’t have to leave Galois to do it. I looked for opportunities where my skills and “joy at work” intersected with Galois’s needs, and—over and over again—Galois supported my changing roles to fit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It all comes back to our core belief that personal joy and professional success are not mutually exclusive, but rather intertwined factors that contribute to a fulfilling work experience. For me, those beliefs empowered my career progression, turning “Joy at Work” from an abstract idea into a lived experience that has profoundly shaped my professional journey at Galois.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Putting the Voice of Customers into the Software Development Process</title>
      <link>https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20231017-putting-the-voice-of-customers-into-the-software-development-process/</link>
      <description>**关键词**：用户反馈，开发流程，用户价值，自动化分类，交互式仪表盘

**大纲**：
- 用户反馈在Mercari应用的开发流程中的重要性
- Mercari如何整合用户反馈并改进开发流程
- Hack Fest项目：使用机器学习自动分类用户反馈
- 通过交互式仪表盘改进周度反馈报告
- 未来的改进和合作机会

**总结**：
本文介绍了Mercari如何将用户反馈整合到应用的开发流程中，以增加用户价值和改进应用。他们通过分析和提取用户评论，使用机器学习自动化分类，建立了一个能够有效处理大量用户反馈的系统。之后，他们通过创建交互式仪表盘，使不同团队可以方便地访问和分析用户反馈，进一步改进了开发流程。文章还提到了未来的改进方向，包括更高效的沟通、更多数据整合以及与其他团队的合作。总之，Mercari积极利用用户反馈来提高应用的质量和用户体验，并不断改进流程以提供更多价值给用户。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, a vast amount of users open the App Store or the Google Play Store to leave ratings and reviews about the Mercari application. They generously provide insights into what they like and dislike, what they find valuable, and what they do not. At Mercari, our mission is to &amp;quot;circulate all forms of value to unleash the potential in all people.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User feedback in the form of app reviews is an invaluable connection between our customers and us. Incorporating this feedback into our development process allows us to unleash the full potential of our application and make it even more valuable to our users, which truly resonates with our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of users access our application daily, and chances are, you are one of them! Our users employ a wide range of devices, operating systems, and varying conditions when utilizing the Mercari mobile application (other open apps, available RAM memory, battery saving mode, phone configuration options, and many others). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducting comprehensive testing under all these circumstances is realistically impossible. While we can leverage the power of logs to understand user behavior and identify crashes, user feedback in the form of reviews provides a more profound insight. These reviews tell the stories of people who use and experience our application, sometimes sharing their positive experiences, and at times, encountering difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As QA Engineers and Managers, anything related to user value is of great interest to us. After all, quality can be defined as &amp;quot;Value to Some Person.&amp;quot; In many cases, our users personify that definition. This is why, as a QA team, we have taken the initiative to integrate user feedback into our development process. Guided by the culture at Mercari, we have collaborated with various teams in order to build a process where everyone can harness the immense treasure trove that lies within Mercari&amp;#8217;s application user reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is a process where we leverage ML to analyze, week by week, all reviews given to our app in the Google Play Store and App Store. The summarization and extraction of information improved cross functional communication between our teams, with the combined goals of addressing issues and considering improvements reported by our users, as well as constantly learning what is in the mind of our users and what they value of our products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One recent instance where user feedback took a protagonistic role on our software development process was on the run up to the launch of Mercari&amp;#8217;s new application in 2022, code-named GU, short for &amp;quot;Ground Up&amp;quot;. GU was more than just an update; it was a complete overhaul of the application. If you&amp;#8217;re curious about the whole experience, be sure to check out our article below on the GU application development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related article (&lt;a href="https://mercan.mercari.com/en/articles/35887/"&gt;https://mercan.mercari.com/en/articles/35887/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the importance of involving our users in the development process, we knew that the success of the new app launch hinged on their collaboration. With a diverse range of devices, operating systems, configurations, and conditions, our users offered invaluable perspectives that we couldn&amp;#8217;t simulate in-house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate this communication, we launched volunteer-based beta programs on the App Store and Google Play Store, giving iOS and Android users the opportunity to try out the new application as soon as we had the new version of the app to a certain level of maturity. Users could share their feedback through a dedicated in-app feedback form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened next exceeded our expectations. We were overwhelmed with the sheer volume of feedback from our users, presenting us with the challenge of sorting and categorizing the data into actionable information for our teams. Our software engineers were busy typing away at their keyboards, focusing on delivering our new version as fast as they could, making it impossible to invest in building an automated system to analyze user feedback. Instead, we had no choice but to tackle this task manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a joint effort between our Voice of Customer (VoC) and QA Engineering teams, analyzing the feedback proved to be a complex task. We faced challenges such as identifying duplicate feedback, language barriers, effectively communicating the feedback to the right teams, and keeping up with the daily influx of feedback. It consumed a significant amount of our time. However, our efforts paid off. Not only did we uncover a fair share of hard to reproduce issues on the app, but we were also able to prioritize our tasks based on the quantity of reports received from users on specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s no exaggeration to say that the success of the app launch was partly attributed to the incredible Mercari users who generously shared their feedback. We were able to address problems, compatibility glitches with other apps, crashes, and even gather improvement suggestions. By taking their feedback into account, we avoided the chaos of encountering all of these issues on launch day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine the turmoil that would have ensued if all users experienced these problems simultaneously! Thanks to the continuous iterative approach of listening to feedback and making necessary improvements, we seamlessly transitioned users into the new GU app. At a company level, we learned a valuable lesson about the immeasurable value of user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hack Fest Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successfully launching the GU program and wrapping up Beta testing, I felt something was off with this user feedback channel shutting down. Though analyzing it was time-consuming, it provided valuable insight to our team. Instead of focusing less on this, I wondered if we could process more feedback with a more streamlined approach. To scale effectively, we needed to automate feedback categorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Initial slide of the presentation of our Hack Fest project: Feedback Classification (should have gone with a fancier name)" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prd-engineering-asset/2023/10/bcdc8c2d-voc_qa_process_hack_fest.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Initial slide of the presentation of our Hack Fest project: Feedback Classification (should have gone with a fancier name)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain traction on this notion, I pitched the idea on the ML Engineering Slack channel. Much to my delight, some colleagues showed keen interest, and one ML engineer named Paul Willot went further by becoming committed to making this a reality. Concurrently, I also discussed potential data sources with our Customer Support team and found support there as well, with Kazue Kudo san from their team deciding to champion things from the VoC side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to our bi-annual &lt;a href="https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230621-e066032084/" title="Hack Fest event"&gt;Hack Fest event&lt;/a&gt;, a 3-day coding marathon open to all employees, we began shaping the framework of our project. With other new members, who jumped on board at the last minute, our objective was to build a minimum viable product (MVP) – an API that could autonomously categorize user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial step was to determine suitable categories for feedback. A balance between broad and overly detailed categories would need to be struck. We eventually settled on eight categories, after initially considering more than ten and doing fine tuning over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was the challenge of training our model. The estimate was that we would need approximately 100 reviews per category to showcase the model&amp;#8217;s effectiveness. Combining our efforts, we managed to manually classify sufficient reviews across all categories, hopefully for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Hack Fest was drawing to a close, our ML engineer readied the model and prepared a proof of concept (PoC) site. Despite time constraints, we presented the working model and its potential benefits to our processes. Our project was well-received, even bagging a &lt;a href="https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230621-e066032084/" title="Special Mention"&gt;Special Mention&lt;/a&gt; from one of the judges (Maekawa Miho-san). However, we realized that this success marked merely the beginning of a greater journey towards fully implementing user feedback into our software development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Template of the reports shared in Slack. This one breaks down the feedback in different categories for teams to work on. Monthly, we would share some graphs as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following months, our model filtered user feedback related to bugs or improvements, assisting in compiling weekly reports. This helped us to quickly evaluate weekly feedback by diving into the reviews that were classified as the categories we cared about the most. We picked out the topics most mentioned by our users and prioritized investigations on them. We also helped prioritize existing tickets with this information. Additionally, we collected improvements laid out by our users to enhance the capabilities of our apps. User input became an essential part of our development process, helping us detect issues and fine-tune features. While we acknowledged the potential to do more with this invaluable tool, we also identified some limitations and areas for future improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Real&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the positive response we received from our weekly reports, there were evident gaps in our process. But, in the spirit of innovation and continuous improvement, we recognized this as an opportunity to refine our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key issue was that stakeholders had limited access to the raw reviews. To address their queries, we had to manually sift through the reports, an exercise that was far from efficient. Similarly, recurrent albeit less common feedback often got overlooked due to its sparse occurrence in our weekly reports. Moreover, our process lacked instant, visually appealing data presentations like graphs, timelines or charts to help quickly comprehend the story behind numbers. Lastly, our not yet mature process had a tendency of duplicating data unnecessarily, a clear area for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen to tackle these pain points, we decided to revolutionize our weekly feedback reports. Our vision was to create an interactive dashboard that allowed stakeholders to access, filter, search, and analyze user feedback data as per their needs. We believed this would help unleash not just the potential of user data but also our team&amp;#8217;s innovative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began the transformation by defining the specifications for the new dashboard. To ensure its efficiency, we created mock data sets for testing and refinement. The upgraded dashboard would now enable users to filter reviews by dates, ratings, categorization, and relevance tags. Realizing the importance of seamless communication, we even integrated a feature for conducting keyword searches in both English and Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping data duplication in check was our next goal. Following several productive discussions, we worked in cohesion with the VoC team and QA to co-own the user reviews data. This allowed us to modify the data without creating redundancies. We also added a &amp;quot;Feature&amp;quot; column as suggested by the VoC team, to clearly highlight which application functionality the feedback pertained to. As part of this journey, we automated some processes previously handled by the VoC team, in collaboration with QA. This teamwork was a testament to Mercari’s collaborative culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prd-engineering-asset/2023/10/e78ad3c0-voc_qa_process_dashboard.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sneak peek of the dashboard we have in place, showing the filtering options available and some basic graphs. Below there’s much more information, insights on ratings trend, preview of the reviews, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the refined data at our disposal, we integrated it with the dashboard, refining as necessary. We were thrilled to roll out our revised weekly reports complete with interactive dashboards. The overwhelming response from Product Development Teams, all roles included, was delightful to witness. Now, our teams could effectively filter and search for keywords related to new features, shedding light on invaluable insights. Empowering our team with this data seemed like a game-changing move and we’re already excited to witness its far-reaching impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvements for the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we glance into the future, we see rooms for optimization and sophistication, even though we have significantly progressed from the days of manually classifying piles of user feedback. The quest for improvement never stops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to augment our efforts in communication can&amp;#8217;t be denied. Engaging as our internal product feedback channel might be, we also acknowledge that we haven&amp;#8217;t roped everyone into it. The key lies in promoting our dashboards and making them more accessible, so that the wealth of insights within can benefit a wider audience. Moreover, a system to ensure that the highlights from our weekly report digests reach the teams who can act upon them directly, is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of opportunities, our sights are set on pouring more data into our ML model pipeline. We strongly believe there is power in volume. By automating more, we can efficiently review additional feedback and take action instead of being bogged down by manual tasks. One promising proposal is to bring back the in-app feedback form. While another involves widening our range to cover feedback from other platforms like SNS. Indeed, our current model may need some fine-tuning for these new data sources, but the potential wealth of unique insights is an exciting prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an alliance with the Customer Support (CS) team feels like a natural progression. CS creates investigations for repeated inquiries about the application behavior, and we do something quite similar for repeated user reviews of our app. We believe a collaboration may pave the way for a unified process or cross-utility of our data sets to boost the quality of the solutions we&amp;#8217;re able to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this journey of continuously refining our approach to harnessing user feedback stands as a testament to our unwavering commitment to quality at Mercari. The narrative underscores the profound impact of collaboration between different teams within the company, as well as the potential for continuous improvement in our delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the initial struggle with overwhelming feedback, the manual categorization of data, to the development of an automated system through our Hack Fest project, we&amp;#8217;ve come a long way in understanding and integrating user feedback. The creation of an interactive dashboard has positively revolutionized our weekly feedback reports, enabling the different teams to efficiently use and discern data. Furthermore, the role the VoC and QA teams played in refining our use of data underscores the richness of diverse collaborations within Mercari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we recognize that our journey is far from over. There remain opportunities for more efficient communication, further data integration, and exploration of fruitful alliances with more teams within the company. As we continue evolving and embracing these opportunities, our aim remains clear: to deliver ever-greater value to the users of our application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing our unique experiences, we hope to spark dialogue and collaboration beyond Mercari&amp;#8217;s walls. The strength of user feedback should never be underestimated. When harnessed effectively, it has the power to transform services, enhance user experience, and prompt targeted enhancements that truly resonate with user needs. As such, it is an invaluable resource in our mission to &amp;quot;circulate all forms of value to unleash the potential in all people”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Build Lightning Web Components Faster with Code Snippets</title>
      <link>https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2023/10/build-lightning-web-components-faster-with-code-snippets.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implementing &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components"&gt;Salesforce Base Lightning Web Components&lt;/a&gt; just got easier with the addition of HTML Code Snippets in &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode"&gt;the Salesforce Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt; for Visual Studio Code (v58.6.2). This update complements JavaScript and Apex Code Snippets which have been a part of the VS Code extension since 2018. The introduction of HTML Code Snippets allows developers to produce the boilerplate markup required for an LWC and fill in the property values without having to pivot between their editor and documentation. By using Code Snippets, developers will no longer forget a property, misspell a component name, or leave out ARIA elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will explain what Code Snippets are, how to use them, and how you can build your own for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are Code Snippets?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this blog focuses on Code Snippets for HTML, they can be written and scoped to any language. Code Snippets leverage IntelliSense to offer robust code-completion options directly in VS Code. What makes Code Snippets different from traditional code completion/hinting tools is their ability to contain large blocks of code or markup with designated points for customization. When a code snippet is inserted into your file, pre-defined sections are made available to enter variable names, adjust properties, or pick from a list of values — all while keeping your hands on the keyboard. The blocks of code provide handy default values as you might find in developer documentation, further allowing you to speed along in the development process. Default implementations serve as a way to encourage best practices and reduce needless back and forth during code review. With Code Snippets, developers spend less time writing boilerplate code and more time adjusting the settings that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Snippets really demonstrate their power when you see them in action. Take for example a custom component that displays a Lightning Button Menu. To produce this functionality, the developer creates a parent Lightning Button Menu, nests a template, and iterates over the list of Menu Items which produces this code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;pre language="html"&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;lightning-button-menu
alternative-text="Show menu"
menu-alignment="auto"
&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;template for:each={myMenuItems} for:item="menuItem"&amp;amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;lt;lightning-menu-item
    key={menuItem.id}
    value={menuItem.value}
    label={menuItem.label}
    &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/lightning-menu-item&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;/template&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;/lightning-button-menu&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with our screen recording video below in which the developer uses Code Snippets to quickly produce the same block of code. With a few quick keystrokes, the outer Lightning Button Menu, for-loop, and corresponding Menu Item tags are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Code Snippets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML Code Snippets were introduced in version 58.6.2 of the &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode"&gt;Salesforce Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt; for VS Code and cover &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components"&gt;Salesforce Base Lightning Web Components&lt;/a&gt;. With your desired file open in the editor, you can search for code snippets in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the VS Code command palette and run the Insert Snippet command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open an HTML file in VS Code and begin typing the component name, for example &lt;code&gt;pill&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, type the component name, &lt;code&gt;pill&lt;/code&gt;. A menu appears showing multiple &lt;code&gt;lwc-pill&lt;/code&gt; components that offer implementation variations that coincide with &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-pill/example"&gt;component library examples&lt;/a&gt;. Select &lt;code&gt;lwc-pill-avatar&lt;/code&gt; by clicking the name or highlighting the option and hitting the tab on the keyboard. Immediately, the markup will paste into the editor and the cursor will land on the first element requiring input. Upon entering the label value, press the tab to go to the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; property. You can choose to use the variable reference as is or update it to match the variable name in your JavaScript file. Reaching the variant property, two options will be presented as a drop-down menu, allowing you to pick either of the two valid options. Pressing the tab after entering the alternative text will move your cursor to the end of the component.&lt;br /&gt;

/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I create my own?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! Code Snippets are a great resource for project teams who build custom components or leverage repetitive code throughout their application and want to make it easy for team members to implement patterns. Some quick examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commented file headers to include your company name, license, etc.; in fact, Salesforce includes such a snippet in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/blob/develop/.vscode/snippets.code-snippets"&gt;VS Code Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the correct copyright notices are included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom LWC component implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API call constructors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated test scaffolding; just having the curly braces and parents filled out is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects can create their own sets of snippets by creating a &lt;code&gt;snippets.code-snippets&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;.vscode/&lt;/code&gt; directory of their project. Since it is a part of the project’s repository, all team members will benefit from updates throughout the dev lifecycle. This allows teams to make opinionated decisions about the structure of code and how it is implemented. If components have a lot of properties or implementation patterns, multiple versions of a code snippet can be created to accommodate different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing to VS Code Extension Snippets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode"&gt;Salesforce Extensions for VS Code&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source project and is open to external contributions. Be sure to follow the repo’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;contributing instructions&lt;/a&gt; which specify how to set up your environment, structure your commits, and sign a Contributor’s License Agreement. To test your updates, save changes locally, open &lt;b&gt;Run&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Debug&lt;/b&gt; from the sidebar, select &lt;b&gt;Launch Extension&lt;/b&gt;, and click &lt;b&gt;Play&lt;/b&gt;. This will compile the extension and open a new VS Code window, allowing you to test updates. Once confirmed, commit your changes and submit a Pull Request!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting LWC Code Snippets can be a boon for developers by helping them produce error-free code in a timely fashion. What’s more, teams can build code snippets to meet project needs and spread best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further resources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

- Amazon CodeWhisperer 推出了定制化功能，可以根据私有代码库生成特定的代码推荐
- 定制化功能的使用步骤

- Amazon CodeWhisperer 定制化功能的使用示例

**总结：**
此篇文章介绍了Amazon CodeWhisperer的定制化功能，它可以根据私有代码库为开发人员生成特定的代码推荐。目前现有的AI编码协助工具通常只能基于开源代码进行训练，无法定制化，这给开发人员带来了一系列挑战。而Amazon CodeWhisperer的定制化功能允许组织自定义代码推荐，包括私有库中的内部库、API、包、类和方法。通过连接GitHub、GitLab或BitBucket等代码库，管理员可以创建定制化，并在团队成员的IDE中获取实时的定制化代码推荐。这项功能有助于提高开发人员的生产力，并确保代码的质量和安全性。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;An AI coding companion, such as &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/"&gt;Amazon CodeWhisperer&lt;/a&gt;, aims to improve developers’ productivity by helping them write code quickly and securely. However, in particular cases, developers need to have code recommendations based on their internal libraries and APIs they extensively use every day.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As most of the existing AI coding companion tools are trained only on open-source codes, they lack the capability to customize the code recommendations using private code repositories. This limitation presents a variety of challenges for developers. Developers have a difficulty learning how to use internal libraries correctly and avoid security problems. For large codebases, it requires hours of reading documentation to understand what code needs to be written to complete the task.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now in Preview — &amp;nbsp;Amazon CodeWhisperer Customization Capability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I’m excited to announce Amazon CodeWhisperer customization capability (in preview) that enables organizations to customize CodeWhisperer to generate specific code recommendations from private code repositories. With this feature, developers who are part of &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-prof-devs.html"&gt;Amazon CodeWhisperer Professional&lt;/a&gt; tier can now receive real-time code recommendations that include their internal libraries, APIs, packages, classes, and methods.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you’re a developer working for a hypothetical food delivery company called AnyCompany. You’re given a task to process a list of unassigned food deliveries around the driver’s current location. Previously, with CodeWhisperer, it would not know the correct internal APIs to process unassigned food deliveries or getting driver’s current location as this isn’t publicly available information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now, with customization capability, you can ask CodeWhisperer to provide recommendations that include specific code related to the company’s internal services. The following screenshot shows how CodeWhisperer generates codes based on the internal codebase just by writing a set of comments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-code.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75995 size-full" height="560" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-code.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="813" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the customization capability of utilizing your internal codebase, CodeWhisperer now understands the intent, determines which internal and public APIs are best suited to the task, and generates code recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How It Works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The explanation above described how you can use CodeWhisperer customization capability as a developer. Now, let me share how it works and how you can get started.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-1-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75782" height="586" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-1-1-1024x586.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To create a customization, you need to complete the following steps as a CodeWhisperer administrator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Administer your end users as &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/as-whisper-admin.html"&gt;CodeWhisperer administrator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Connect to existing repositories. You can connect one or more code repositories in your GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket account using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; Connections or manually upload all of your codes into an &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)&lt;/a&gt; bucket.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create a customization. CodeWhisperer will customize its model based on your codebase.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Activate the customization for your team members. Once the customization is created, you can review and manually activate the customization to make it available automatically in your team members’ IDEs.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This capability provides two main advantages: providing real-time customized code recommendations that are specific to organizations and ensuring the protection of valuable intellectual property. Organizations can now promote the use of code that meets their quality and security standards based on their codes in existing repositories.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, CodeWhisperer helps to ensure the security of your codes by providing the option to encrypt your customization data using customer managed keys in &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"&gt;AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)&lt;/a&gt;. This customization data will be deleted once the customization job finishes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me show you how you can use the Amazon CodeWhisperer customization capability.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get started, I need to create a customization. I need to have administrator access to navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Create customization &lt;/strong&gt;page on the Amazon CodeWhisperer dashboard.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-2-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75991 size-large" height="1024" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-2-1-754x1024.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="754" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Create customization&lt;/strong&gt; page, I can connect the desired private code repositories I want CodeWhisperer to train. Currently, CodeWhisperer customization capability supports connection to GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket via &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; Connections. If I have codes that are not in any code repositories, I can also manually upload my codes into an S3 bucket and define the Amazon S3 URI.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot shows that I have existing connections with my code repositories using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; Connections. I can also create a new connection by selecting&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Create new connection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-3-1-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75993 size-large" height="625" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-3-1-1-1024x625.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then, I can select&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Create Customization&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;so CodeWhisperer can start training the model based on the codes available in the connection. The duration to complete this process depends on the size of the code repositories.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-4-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75994 size-large" height="846" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-4-1-1024x846.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When the customization is ready, CodeWhisperer will not activate it automatically. This gives me the flexibility to activate the customizations just when I need them. But before I demonstrate that, I’d like to explain the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;score.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In short, the evaluation score helps me to measure the customization’s accuracy in predicting and providing code recommendations based on the codes in my code repositories. It provides a score in one of three categories: 1) Very Good, with a score ranging from 7–10; 2) Fair, with a score ranging from 4–7; and 3) Poor, with a score ranging from 0–4. It’s recommended to activate the customization if the evaluation score is 6 or higher. If the evaluation score is less than desired, I need to make sure that I’m providing enough codes for customization and provide a new code dataset that extensively contains references to internal APIs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here, I can see the &lt;strong&gt;Evaluation score&lt;/strong&gt; for my customization is 8, and I’m happy with this result. Then, I can select&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Activate&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to start using this customization.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75777" height="488" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-4-1024x488.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once I have activated the customizations, I can define the access to selected customizations by selecting&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Add users&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, I can give access to the customizations for selected team members who have been added as users for Amazon CodeWhisperer Professional tier. To do that, I can follow the guide from &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/as-whisper-admin.html"&gt;the&amp;nbsp;Administering end users&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-6.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75778" height="654" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-6-1024x654.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then, once my team members sign in via AWS Toolkit in their IDEs, they will see the available customizations and can start using them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-8.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75977 size-large" height="542" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-8-1024x542.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With Amazon CodeWhisperer, I can create multiple customizations by providing different code repositories. This feature is useful if I want to build customizations for code recommendations for certain teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-9-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75984 size-large" height="293" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-9-1-1024x293.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As administrator, I can also monitor the performance of each of the customizations by navigating to the CodeWhisperer dashboard page. This page summarizes useful data such as user activity, how many lines of code were suggested by CodeWhisperer and accepted by my team members, and how many security scans have successfully been run from IDEs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-7.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75779" height="647" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-7-1024x647.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Amazon CodeWhisperer customization capability also follows the supported IDEs as part of AWS Toolkit by Amazon CodeWhisperer, such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ JetBrains, Visual Studio, and AWS Cloud9. This feature also provides support for most popular programming languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#.&lt;/p&gt;

The depth of knowledge shared by experts was truly impressive, and their innovative problem-solving approaches were captivating. Here are a few takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;#xa0;Tim Berglund emphasized the significance of analytics for end-users and showcased the rapid ingestion of streaming data via Apache Kafka into &lt;a href="https://pinot.apache.org/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Pinot&lt;/a&gt;, delivering lightning-fast results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. A panel discussion, moderated by Danica, delved into the strengths and weaknesses of various stream processing technologies, such as Apache Kafka Streams, Apache Flink, &lt;a href="https://spark.apache.org/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Apache Spark&lt;/a&gt;, and Apache Pulsar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Notable insights emerged from the sessions on building real-time applications with Apache Kafka, Flink, and Druid, presented by Kai Waehner and Gian Merlino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="sponsors-booths"&gt;Sponsors&amp;apos; Booths&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference featured an impressive lineup of sponsors and exhibitors, including &lt;a href="https://www.deltastream.io/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;DeltaStream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Elastic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://startree.ai/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;StarTree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nstream.io/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Nstream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://streamnative.io/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;StreamNative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://redpanda.com/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Redpanda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudera.com/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cloudera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.decodable.co/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Decodable&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://rockset.com/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Rockset&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://imply.io/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Imply&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.risingwave.com/?ref=bigeng.io" rel="noreferrer"&gt;RisingWave Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and much more.

**总结：**
本文介绍了Meta公司的Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF)以及其在产品释放方面的重要性和影响。SCARF为工程师提供了指导，并结合自动化技术减轻了工程师的负担。文章指出了产品释放的复杂性和潜在的失败模式，并介绍了SCARF如何通过工作流管理和删除路线图的创建来解决这些问题。文章还介绍了动态和静态分析技术在SCARF中的应用，以及自动化和人工干预之间的结合。通过SCARF的使用，Meta公司成功地删除了大量的无用数据和代码，提高了产品和服务的质量。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF) is Meta&amp;#8217;s unused code and data deletion framework.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF guides engineers through deprecating a product safely and efficiently via an internal tool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF combines this tooling with automation to reduce load on engineers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At Meta, we are constantly innovating and experimenting by building and shipping many different products, and those products comprise thousands of individual features. As part of this healthy technology lifecycle, it is inevitable that certain products or features will be deprecated. For example, in 2015 we launched a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2015/06/introducing-moments/"&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;photo-sharing app called Moments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, which was later deprecated in 2019. So, how did we efficiently and safely remove all of the code and data related to Moments without adversely affecting Meta&amp;#8217;s other products and services?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this three-part blog series, we will discuss the complexities involved in removing a product from a complex portfolio of products and the framework Meta has built to drive the automation of this process, our Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF). SCARF has had an important impact at Meta. In the last year, it has removed petabytes of unused data across &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;12.8M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; different data types stored in 21 different data systems. Over the last five years it has deleted over 100M lines of code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The first post will introduce the complexities faced when systematically deprecating products safely in a large organization and the internal workflow tools we have developed. The second post will explain how SCARF automates the removal of dead code and the infrastructure that powers it. The third post will discuss SCARF&amp;#8217;s orchestration for safely identifying and deleting unused data types across various data systems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Failure modes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Without established guidance detailing the process for determining when and how to remove a product or feature, a few failure modes might emerge. Consider the example of launching a time-specific feature for a large event that happens once every few years. Does it make sense to keep all the code and data related to it until the next event? Most of the time, maintaining code for a number of years that is unused is less desirable than building a new experience for the next event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Engineers who do attempt the cleanup might find that doing so is a very time-consuming job. Correctly identifying all the pieces of code and data associated with the product and only taking action on those specific pieces of code and data is a laborious process. It’s possible that a table that is still being used, or code that is still required for a shared use case, could be included in the scope of a deletion effort. For example, some tables might be shared between products. Hypothetically, Moments may have started life as an extension to Facebook photos before it became a separate app.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Most importantly, it&amp;#8217;s crucial that any cleanup efforts only remove things that are actively being deprecated or are already entirely unused. Deleting something that is actively being used in production could cause bad experiences for users. The interconnected nature of features within a large product like Facebook makes this a very real possibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;How did we solve this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Meta has developed playbooks describing how to safely deprecate a product. These playbooks describe how to notify people and give them time to download their data, how to disable the product safely, and when to eventually delete the underlying code and data. They describe how and when to perform a product or feature deprecation, but actually removing the code and data for a product or feature is an engineering problem with an engineering solution. The engineering solution we have built does not replace these guides, but enables engineers to more safely and efficiently complete the product deprecation process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this post, we’ll describe Meta&amp;#8217;s SCARF and how it guides engineers through this cleanup process. In subsequent posts, we will discuss its limitations and how they are mitigated by our automated dead code and data removal platforms. To start, we introduce Meta&amp;#8217;s suite of internal tools developed to orchestrate both of these systems in guiding engineers to remove large products with complex dependencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Introducing workflow management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To simplify the task of removing a product, Meta has built a product deprecation workflow management tool into SCARF to help engineers delete a product&amp;#8217;s dead code and unused data safely and efficiently. This tool lets engineers understand and break down the steps they’ll go through during the deprecation and coordinates the actions of SCARF to bring automation to bear with an engineer&amp;#8217;s guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Engineers can import their product or feature into SCARF, which then determines the constituent pieces of code and data, and identifies internal and external dependencies on these assets. SCARF automatically processes this information to guide engineers on the correct order of operations to delete assets safely and shows their progress relative to the desired end-state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Any assets that are safe to be deleted immediately will be handled by SCARF&amp;#8217;s automated code and data cleanup systems (which will be covered in more depth in our subsequent blog posts). Engineers are able to track this automation and accelerate it by using their domain knowledge combined with SCARF&amp;#8217;s scoping analysis, which determines the assets that are safe to remove. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Scoping the deprecation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Understanding when a piece of code or data is used by other components of a product is important, and detecting when an asset is referenced in the codebase of other products is crucial for a safe deprecation (the internal and external dependencies, respectively). For example, we would not want to leave a dead web link between two different products because that could lead to a bad user experience. An engineer deprecating a product must think carefully about each such dependency in the external boundary of their product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To avoid these complications, engineers begin their deprecations by scoping the project, recursively adding any assets that should be deleted, and flagging dependencies that should be severed. For example, if Moments had an integration with the Facebook app’s Sharing feature, this dependency must be broken because the Facebook Sharing feature itself may not be in scope for removal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20690" height="491" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image1.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;However, if the Sharing feature was unique to Moments, that would change the scope of removal as we would want to delete that component as well. Adding new assets into the scope of the project as it progresses requires further analysis to discover the new boundaries of the internal and external dependencies. These dependencies are expected to change over time as an engineer discovers extra components to delete. Alternatively, we may identify code that is actually a shared component and should not be deleted. Attempting to finalize this boundary from the start is very difficult, so we allow developers to redefine the boundary over time as the deprecation progresses to reflect this growing understanding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The graph of components, their internal and external dependencies, and related data assets, can grow extremely complex in large products. SCARF simplifies this problem by only requiring engineers to make “Flag Dependency” or “Add to Project” decisions at the boundaries. It then internally computes the correct deletion order for everything inside the project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20691" height="577" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image2.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Creating a deletion roadmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Once the set of unused assets to be deleted has been determined, SCARF will analyze the internal and external dependencies and create a deletion roadmap that outlines the correct sequence of steps for deleting everything safely. The roadmap is refreshed each day as changes are made, either from targeted assets being deleted or from modifications to the component graph through the Flag and Add actions. This roadmap is one of the workflow management tool&amp;#8217;s most crucial features. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Without guidance, engineers may attempt to delete everything in one fell swoop by removing an entire code directory without accounting for external systems’ dependencies, where changes cannot be committed atomically. Another example includes deleting data before the code that reads and writes it, which may lead to new data being created that must be cleaned again. Deprecations must be staggered to account for these various requirements and this entails that every deprecation be performed in a coordinated, multi-step process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The key implementation detail is the encoding of business logic that allows products and apps to function in Meta&amp;#8217;s systems. By encoding how users are able to engage with products and how those products communicate with other Meta services, we can ensure that upstream assets are always deleted before their dependencies. For example, typically a product will comprise code in many different languages across multiple repositories. An engineer needs to delete their mobile code (Java, Objective-C) in order to free up and delete their server-side GraphQL definitions. Deleting those GraphQL definitions makes it possible to delete business logic; deleting business logic makes it possible to delete data schema definitions, which in turn allows unused data to be deleted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The following diagram is a hypothetical example of the type of information that is presented to an engineer in their deletion roadmap. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20692" height="997" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image3.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This sequencing isn&amp;#8217;t obvious at the get-go! The links between these system boundaries are often weaker than the link between, for example, two classes in the same language; and the link may often only be discovered by an engineer during continuous testing on their code change requests. SCARF&amp;#8217;s encoding of these inter-system boundaries enables the deletion roadmap which in turn enables engineers to stagger their removal actions safely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Powering the analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF’s workflow management tool is powered by detailed metrics from a combination of both static and dynamic analysis. Information about code is gathered from SCARF’s unified code dependency graph and information about data is gathered from SCARF’s asset usage analysis. These mechanisms will be discussed in more detail in our subsequent blog posts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;These metrics give the workflow management tool a very important property: If metrics can be found for an asset, it is in use and should be blocked from automated deletion. Correspondingly, any asset for which no metrics are available is ready for automatic deletion. With these metrics in hand, SCARF can show engineers a precise explanation of exactly what is blocking the automation and what steps they must manually perform in order for the automation to proceed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This completeness property allows SCARF to automatically begin removing code and data that is unused, while simultaneously showing engineers which things must be handled manually. At every step of the process, both engineers and automation work together to complete the deprecation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Once an engineer has acted upon this information and removed more dead code and unused data in accordance with the deletion roadmap, the continuous indexing and analysis of SCARF will detect these changes and automatically trigger any code/data cleanup it can. Finally, the workflow management tool will update its deletion roadmap to identify the next set of items requiring manual intervention, and the process is repeated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20693" height="582" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image4.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Is automation sufficient?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Some of the usage signals SCARF highlights (such as API endpoints that still receive traffic) do not necessarily cause compilation errors if they are ignored and are more subjective as to whether they should stop automated deletion. If the endpoint for a product receives a single request each day, should we delete it right away? We have already identified that the endpoint belongs to a product we are removing so we know it should be removed eventually, but the answer to when it is correct to delete it is ultimately a business decision. Further, we understand that mistakes can happen and that the automation is not expected to be 100 percent perfect. Therefore, SCARF errs on the side of caution as a mistaken deletion could lead to unrecoverable errors or data loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Correspondingly, SCARF offers the ability to override signals that prevent automation from taking action. In the example above, an engineer might decide we wish to proceed with deleting the API endpoint despite small amounts of traffic. This is extremely valuable when cleaning up internal products, tools, and services. Internal tools are built and deprecated with a much faster cadence than an external product often is and SCARF can help determine each individual internal user of a tool who needs to be asked if they’re agreeable with it being removed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This feature creates a feedback loop between engineers and automation. Our automation highlights usage signals; engineers then triage those usage signals (either by modifying code to remove them or, if applicable, marking the signal as not sufficient to block deletion); then our automation can proceed to progress the SCARF project. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To further accelerate manual changes performed by engineers, SCARF also provides an instant code change feature. SCARF suggests a means for breaking a dependency through a targeted code change and an engineer is able to select one of a predetermined set of possible ways to break it. The change is immediately previewable and a change request can be immediately generated for review by other engineers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;After an engineer has progressed through a majority of the deletion roadmap and removed the entry points, client code, server code, and any other in-scope assets, they will be left with unused tables of data that can now be automatically cleaned up by SCARF. This automation will be explained in more detail in our future blog posts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Integration with other tools at Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF is useful for more than just product deprecation. We surface deprecation as an option when notifying engineers about routine maintenance or upgrade work on individual assets. For example, when asking developers to migrate away from a legacy internal API, we can include an option for them to deprecate the callsite or affected product and import their code into SCARF. Deprecating something can, in many cases, be more work than performing a simple upgrade, but deprecation means that no future maintenance work is necessary. Once something has been removed, future maintenance costs go to zero.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We hope you’ll look forward to our subsequent posts in the series, which will cover SCARF&amp;#8217;s automated code and data deletion, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Read on for the latest news fraud findings from Sift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Account takeovers skyrocket &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five consumers recently surveyed by Sift have experienced account takeover (ATO) attacks, with 62% of those taking place in the past year. The prevalence of these types of attacks is supported by Sift’s latest &lt;a href="https://resources.sift.com/ebook/q3-2023-digital-trust-safety-index-account-takeover-data-consumer-insights-and-emerging-trends/"&gt;Q3 Digital Trust &amp;amp; Safety Index&lt;/a&gt; findings which reveal a staggering 354% year-over-year increase in ATO in Q2 2023 across Sift’s global network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While AI has been a hot topic in the fraud prevention industry, it’s automation that’s still driving the speed and scale of many of these attacks, with the sale of bots that provide ‘ATO-as-a-Service’ for purchase on the deep web.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fraud becomes as sophisticated as the technology being used to commit it,” says Rebecca Alter, Trust and Safety Architect at Sift, “and increasingly innovative types of automation pose a threat to merchants that aren’t ready to match its speed or account for its accessibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Explore more highlights from the report in &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/e-commerce-fraud-to-cost-48-billion-globally-this-year-as-attacks-skyrocket-report-says/"&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sift’s newest integrations and automation capabilities &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With fraudsters collaborating and networking across borders as part of a full-fledged &lt;a href="https://sift.com/fraud-center/fraud-schemes"&gt;Fraud Economy&lt;/a&gt;, Sift is committed to expanding its risk management capabilities to a wider network of fraud fighters. The most recent example of this effort is Sift’s new Dispute Management integrations with PayPal and Adyen, two of the largest payment processors globally. With the combination of Sift’s &lt;a href="https://blog.sift.com/payment-protection-and-dispute-management/"&gt;Dispute Management and Payment Protection solutions&lt;/a&gt;, users can improve the overall payment experience and reduce potential fraud or disputes for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sift Dispute Management has made it faster and easier to respond to chargebacks. Effective integration between Sift, our payment processor, and our own internal tools has improved a once labor intensive process into an efficient, automated system,” said Taylor Snyder, Manager of Risk &amp;amp; Compliance at online bill pay company, Doxo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More industry and customer recognition for Sift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the &lt;a href="https://blog.sift.com/sift-2023-forrester-wave-digital-fraud-management/"&gt;recognition as a ‘Leader’&lt;/a&gt; in the latest Forrester Wave report, Sift also earned accolades from &lt;a href="https://www.marketplacerisk.com/post/marketplace-risk-recognizes-solution-provider-excellence-program-honorees"&gt;Marketplace Risk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/09/15/2744127/0/en/Sift-Named-a-Leader-in-Fraud-Detection-E-commerce-Fraud-Detection-and-Risk-Based-Authentication-on-G2.html"&gt;G2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sift was recognized as one of the top fraud prevention and chargeback management solutions by Marketplace Risk’s Solution Provider Excellence program, which is intended to help marketplaces and digital platforms in selecting solution providers with a proven track record of success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;G2, the largest and most trusted software marketplace, released their Fall 2023 Reports revealing Sift as the only fraud solution provider to have earned Leader status in all three key fraud prevention categories: Fraud Detection, E-Commerce Fraud Detection, and Risk-Based Authentication. G2 rankings are based on authentic customer reviews and scores; Sift’s ranking is based on over 180 authentic Sift user ratings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is one recent review: &amp;#8220;Sift is the partner of choice for fraud prevention. Sift is one of the few tools in our software stacks that has such a clear ROI. We have total transparency with our entire order pipeline to prevent fraudulent purchases. The UI is intuitive and the rules-based engine makes creating and editing rules on the fly a breeze.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microspeak: The As-Appropriate (AA) interviewer</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231017-00/?p=108897</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One term you may hear when people talk about the process of interviewing at Microsoft is the As Appropriate, or AA, interviewer. Why is the final interview of the day called As Appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name is a holdover from how Microsoft used to structure hiring interviews. The term is not officially used any more, but you may still hear it used informally by old-timers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical interview day used to consist of four (sometimes five) interviews, structured as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Start&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;br /&gt;
(as appropriate)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇒&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Recruiter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇒&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇑&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇗&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan="3"&gt;⇐ ⇐ ⇐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of interviews is called an &lt;i&gt;interview loop&lt;/i&gt; because the candidate travels in a loop through the diagram, starting and ending with the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the interviews assesses not just the candidate&amp;#8217;s technical competence but also other factors such as their initiative, ability to teach themselves new things, and how well they work as part of a team. The results of these interviews are all shared with the recruiter and the final interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final interviewer was typically someone more senior in the hiring group. Historically, their job was to take the information provided by the initial interviewers and, based on their recommendations, decide whether the candidate was still worth pursuing. If so, then they proceeded with the final interview. if not, then they sent the candidate directly to the recruiter after completing their final &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; interview. The final interviewer was called the &amp;#8220;as appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer because the final interview took place only if they felt it was appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;#8220;as appropriate&amp;#8221; was often abbreviated in speech to &amp;#8220;as-app&amp;#8221; (pronouncing the &amp;#8220;app&amp;#8221; like the first syllable of &amp;#8220;application&amp;#8221;), and in writing as &amp;#8220;AA&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft hiring interview process has been reworked several times since those early days. For example, at one point, the interviews were restructured so that the interviewer roles are rotated through the day, to improve throughput:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Welcome&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 4&lt;br /&gt;
(as-app)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every interviewer serves as the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer for a candidate. There is no special interviewer who is responsible for being the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the evolution of the interview loop, the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; stopped being optional. Everybody got an &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interview. The role of the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer didn&amp;#8217;t change. It&amp;#8217;s just that the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interview always takes place, regardless of the feedback from the other three interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final interview of the day lost the name &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221;, but people who have been conducting interviews for a long time sometimes accidentally slip into the old terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you feel exhausted after interacting with people? Do you tend to have many thoughts but express them rarely? If so, there&amp;#8217;s no need to stress: you might just be an introvert, and that&amp;#8217;s perfectly fine. Although it might seem that the world is full of extroverted personalities, a &lt;a href="https://www.themyersbriggs.com/en-US/Connect-With-Us/Blog/2020/January/World-Introvert-Day-2020"&gt;significant portion&lt;/a&gt; of the global population is introverted, with some estimates reaching up to 56%. Being introverted is a natural aspect of your personality, akin to having a distinct character trait. Recognize that being introverted doesn&amp;#8217;t necessitate fixing or change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;#8217;ll explore valuable tips and strategies that can help introverts not only navigate but also thrive and excel in the software industry. We&amp;#8217;ll offer practical advice that has proven effective, empowering introverts to embrace their strengths and succeed in this dynamic field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-introversion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Introversion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the main content, let&amp;#8217;s understand the concept of introversion. The &lt;a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/introversion"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; defines introversion as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An orientation toward the internal private world of one’s self and one’s inner thoughts and feelings, rather than toward the outer world of people and things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To elaborate, introversion describes individuals who prefer spending time alone or with a few close friends rather than in large social settings. Introverts find solace and inspiration in solitude, and excessive social interaction can be draining for them. They excel in activities that require deep concentration, introspective thinking, and self-rejuvenation. Introversion is simply a natural characteristic of some individuals, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the definition of introversion might lead some to mistakenly think that all introverts are self-centered and reserved. Just like anyone else, introverts have diverse personalities, behaviors, and interests. While extroverts might thrive in large social gatherings and draw energy from external stimuli, introverts may find such situations overwhelming. Importantly, introverts often demonstrate extroverted qualities within their imagination. They bring to social dynamics thoughtful insights, careful analysis, and a calm perspective, enriching interactions in profound ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="characteristics-of-introverts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of Introverts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An introverted individual might exhibit the following traits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preference for solitude&lt;/strong&gt;: They value personal space, which allows them self-reflection, deep thinking, and growth. It&amp;#8217;s a time for rejuvenation, not loneliness.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective socialization&lt;/strong&gt;: They excel in one-on-one settings, prioritizing meaningful connections over large gatherings.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preference for written communication&lt;/strong&gt;: They often communicate better in writing, taking the time to craft their words.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoidance of the limelight&lt;/strong&gt;: They generally feel more at ease in less spotlight-focused environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active listening and observation&lt;/strong&gt;: Their attentive listening is invaluable, making them thoughtful participants in conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Paulo Coelho, a Brazillian novelist, once expressed &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7187940-blessed-are-those-who-do-not-fear-solitude-who-are"&gt;his perspective on solitude&lt;/a&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blessed are those who do not fear solitude, who are not afraid of their own company, who are not always desperately looking for something to do, something to amuse themselves with, something to judge. If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Paulo Coelho&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s discuss how to leverage introversion as a strength in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embracing Introversion in Tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing your introverted qualities is crucial in the tech industry. Introverts often think independently, forming unique perspectives. Whether this stems from a love of solitude or frequent alone time, it&amp;#8217;s a trait that can inspire disruptive ideas and innovations. So, harness this power to flourish in tech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, several successful entrepreneurs, such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Marissa Mayer, Larry Page, and Elon Musk, identify as introverts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a Q&amp;amp;A session, Bill Gates was once questioned about his success in a world that is predominantly extroverted,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/05/bill-gates-how-to-succeed-as-an-introvert/"&gt;shared his perspective on being an introvert&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I think introverts can do quite well. If you’re clever you can learn to get the benefits of being an introvert, which might be, say, being willing to go off for a few days and think about a tough problem, read everything you can, push yourself very hard to think out on the edge of that area. Then, if you come up with something, if you want to hire people, get them excited, build a company around that idea, you better learn what extroverts do, you better hire some extroverts, like Steve Ballmer I would claim as an extrovert, and tap into both sets of skills in order to have a company that thrives both as in deep thinking and building teams and going out into the world to sell those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-a-supportive-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a Supportive Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a misconception to assume all introverts avoid networking. Networking isn&amp;#8217;t exclusive to extroverts; introverts, with their active listening, observation, and genuine curiosity, can also excel in building relationships. Remember, introversion doesn&amp;#8217;t limit career success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Platforms like LinkedIn offer a space for expanding professional networks. Joining forums, tech communities, and social media groups can also help. Within the workplace, seeking mentors and peer support, especially from those who understand introversion, can be invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="navigating-teamwork-and-collaboration"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating Teamwork and Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re familiar with modern software development practices, you&amp;#8217;ll know that many teams implement Agile methodologies. In the software industry, teamwork and collaboration form the cornerstone of daily operations. Engaging in discussions is essential to various aspects of the development process. While tasks like coding and documentation can be done individually, many activities rely on group conversations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In software development:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design is a collective process involving team discussions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Architecture decisions arise from discussions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pair and mob programming encourage collaboration and team dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Code and pull request reviews involve feedback exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Scrum rituals, such as daily stand-ups and retrospectives, use discussions to align the team and refine the development process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For introverts, these routines can initially seem daunting. Agile demands frequent team interactions, brainstorming sessions, and daily stand-ups, which can be socially taxing. The perpetual need for social interaction can sap their energy. Moreover, introverts might struggle to express their thoughts in larger group settings because they tend to reflect deeply before speaking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a manager, your responsibility includes fostering an inclusive environment for introverts. Individuals in leadership roles should recognize and accommodate introverted team members. Understand that they might not always feel at ease speaking in group settings. Consider implementing anonymous communication channels or feedback methods. Regular check-ins with introverted team members can ensure they remain engaged. Such actions show care, motivating them to commit and deliver quality work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By cultivating psychological safety, introverts will feel more confident sharing their ideas. This nurtures a collaborative atmosphere, incorporating varied viewpoints from the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mastering-communication-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Communication Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not uncommon for introverts to receive feedback during performance evaluations suggesting greater visibility. This might be a nuanced way of advising them to vocalize their achievements more. It could also indicate that honing communication skills could be advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding this feedback is essential. However, adapting to it shouldn&amp;#8217;t mean forsaking one&amp;#8217;s introverted nature. Improving visibility isn&amp;#8217;t about imitating extroverted tendencies; it&amp;#8217;s about effectively communicating while staying authentic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can enhance your communication by practicing active listening, preparing thoughts beforehand, and being concise. Prioritizing written communication can also be advantageous, allowing clearer articulation of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enhancing communication as an introvert is about striking a balance. It involves utilizing unique strengths to convey ideas and accomplishments effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cultivating-a-growth-mindset"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating a Growth Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The software industry is ever-evolving, with new trends and technologies emerging regularly. Success demands not only a foundation in computer science fundamentals (for certain roles) but also a growth mindset and a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills"&gt;T-shaped &lt;/a&gt;approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;T-shaped developers possess deep expertise in one discipline (the vertical bar of the T) and broader, albeit shallower, knowledge in related fields (the horizontal bar). This model suggests that while having a specialty is crucial, versatility is also valuable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adopting a growth mindset entails actively seeking learning opportunities and viewing challenges as growth prospects. In simpler terms, it&amp;#8217;s the belief that abilities and intelligence can evolve through dedication, practice, and learning. To thrive in tech, remain open to new experiences, such as industry conferences, workshops, or online courses. Familiarizing yourself with emerging tools and technologies not only broadens your horizons but also helps connect with peers who have similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combining a growth mindset with a T-shaped approach ensures adaptability in the tech landscape, fostering continuous learning and relevance in software development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this article underscores the importance of understanding introversion as an intrinsic trait rather than a shortcoming. It&amp;#8217;s crucial for organizations to value independent thought and individual perspectives, enabling introverts to introduce innovative ideas. To succeed in the software domain, introverts must harness their distinctive qualities. Recognizing and leveraging these traits can lead to valuable contributions and a flourishing career in the software sector.&lt;/p&gt;

**总结**

本文介绍了Mike Rodden创建的AI-powered博客Softwine.ai，该博客结合了葡萄酒和技术领域，旨在促进这两个领域的跨界对话。Mike通过博客分享有关葡萄酒和技术的知识、观点和新闻，并探讨了AI在葡萄园管理和葡萄酒行业中的应用。AI在博客中发挥了重要作用，扮演图形设计师和文章大纲生成器的角色，帮助提高博客的效率。Mike使用Hostinger AI Website Builder搭建了他的网站，并赞赏了这个平台的简单易用和个性化功能。总体而言，Softwine.ai是一个充满激情的项目，旨在促进葡萄酒和技术两个领域之间的交流和思考。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Rodden is a software product manager from Boston with a hobby: he is the creative force behind &lt;a href="http://www.softwine.ai" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Softwine.ai&lt;/a&gt;, an AI-powered blog about wine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Softwine.ai combines two topics that may initially appear mutually exclusive – winemaking and technology. So when Mike writes about wine, it’s always through a modern lens, focused on the technological frontier of the industry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Mike had built a few websites before, he was looking for a simpler platform for his blog. Hostinger AI Website Builder was the ideal solution – its Plug&amp;#8217;n&amp;#8217;Play nature let Mike get his vision off the ground in no time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-vino-veritas"&gt;In Vino Veritas&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wine had always been a passion of Mike’s, but he became even more interested in it after learning about the Wine &amp;amp; Spirit Education Trust (WSET) program. It took two years to finish, and in September this year, Mike celebrated achieving his WSET certification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike started Softwine.ai as a way to bridge the gap between his hobby and profession. The blog allows him to share knowledge, opinions, and news in two contrasting areas – wine and technology – with aims to spark cross-conversation in both arenas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Softwine illustration. " class="wp-image-5635" height="610" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/softwine-art-1024x610.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The wine industry is a little bit traditional – they don&amp;#8217;t adapt to technology super well,” Mike reveals. “But there are some wineries that are really embracing it. They&amp;#8217;re doing some cool stuff, like using data analytics to predict when they have to use chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the kind of subject matter you can expect on Softwine.ai. The blog covers topics like AI technology’s role in integrated pest management (IPM), using weather data to manage vineyards, whether computers can replace sommeliers, and so on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog has also become an effective way to stimulate Mike’s creativity, which would otherwise remain untapped.&amp;nbsp; Since his day job doesn’t provide him with many opportunities to put pen to paper, the blog is a great way to fill the gap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The majority of my day-to-day is more product marketing than actual engineering. Content writing was something I hadn&amp;#8217;t practiced in a long time. So it&amp;#8217;s been a cool way to both practice a little bit and have a creative outlet,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-the-best-collaborator"&gt;AI – The Best Collaborator&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike is the only person behind the blog, with AI having a big enough impact to be featured as a contributor on &lt;a href="https://www.softwine.ai/team" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Softwine.ai’s Team page&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Softwine illustration." class="wp-image-5636" height="574" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/softwine-art-2-1024x574.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, AI is the blog’s graphic designer – it comes up with imaginative illustrations and helps Softwine.ai establish a unique and authentic look. Mike also uses AI-generative technology for article outlines and content creation. As a result, Mike can be more efficient with the limited amount of time he can dedicate to the blog – keeping a close eye on output as part of the editing process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These AI models are actually coming up with ideas I never would have thought of. It could be something I’d never heard of in the wine industry before but then you look it up, and there are so many fresh topics I wouldn’t have been aware of otherwise,” Mike smiles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It does take a good amount of work to make a decent post. But the ability to quickly come up with an outline to just throw your ideas in an order that makes sense – that kind of thing definitely saves a ton of time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hostinger-ai-website-builder-experience"&gt;The Hostinger AI Website Builder Experience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike also used the powers of AI to get the site off the ground. He came across the Hostinger Website Builder when searching online for an accessible platform that wouldn’t be too complex to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’d used other builders and content management systems before to build a couple of websites, and it wasn&amp;#8217;t super impressive. I was looking for something a little bit more out of the box,” Mike reveals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having used Hostinger Website Builder’s AI functionality right off the bat, Mike was impressed with how simple it was to customize the layout of the site and make adjustments on the go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I really like how easy it is to adjust any grid lines and spacing. Everything I do seems to be one or two clicks away at the most, which is great,” Mike says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And since site management is so effortless, Mike can dedicate his time to what matters most – creating standout content for his blog. He doesn’t need to worry about website performance, either – his AI-powered blog is lightweight and loads fast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-days-of-wine-and-roses"&gt;Days of Wine and Roses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the blog is still relatively new, Mike expects its traffic to grow organically in the coming months. He doesn’t rely on paid advertisements to spread awareness; instead, he’s implementing SEO strategies to help Softwine.ai climb the search ranks and bring more visitors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Softwine illustration." class="wp-image-5637" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/softwine-art-3-1024x683.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike isn’t planning to monetize the blog because he wants it to remain a passion project and eventually turn it into a medium for learning. Most important of all is the blog’s natural ability to spark conversation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wine and technology don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of overlap in general. I want to get both camps interested in one another. For that, I like to pick out topics that will make people think and inspire debate. This is especially important since when it comes to wine, people can be a little stubborn in adapting to new things,” Mike says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the reason why Mike doesn’t shy away from controversial subjects – it’s all about giving people food (or drink) for thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get your passion project off the ground in minutes with Hostinger Website Builder, just like Mike did. Start building now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Key Takeaways from #Current2023</title>
      <link>https://blog.cloudera.com/5-key-takeaways-from-current2023/</link>
      <description>**关键词**: Current 2023, Apache Flink, streaming database, Change Data Capture (CDC), tooling for Kafka ecosystem

**大纲**:

文章主要讨论了最近由Confluent举办的Current 2023（即Kafka峰会）的重要性以及会议中关键的五个观点。首先，Apache Flink被广泛认可为流处理的事实标准，其受欢迎程度逐渐接近Spark。其次，出现了一种新兴的竞争对手类型——“流数据库”，他们声称比Flink更快，并且具有更好的工具性能。接下来，Change Data Capture（CDC）的重要性逐渐凸显，Debezium成为CDC的事实标准。此外，关于Kafka生态系统的工具和工具性能有所改善，提供了更多的功能和改进的用户体验。最后，流处理技术仍有进一步发展和成熟的空间，尤其是在数据流的成熟度和实时处理方面。

**总结**: 

本文总结了Current 2023会议的关键观点，其中包括Apache Flink成为流处理的标准，出现了“流数据库”作为对Flink的替代品的新竞争对手，CDC的重要性以及Debezium在该领域的地位，工具性能的改善以及流处理技术的发展和成熟度方面的潜力。然而，尽管流处理技术的采用率不断增长，但其成熟度仍然处于早期阶段。综合而言，流处理仍有很大的发展空间，并且需要完整的工具支持。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1256169936-1-273x182.jpg" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Recently, Confluent hosted Current 2023 (formerly Kafka summit) in San Jose on Sept 26th and 27th. With few conferences curating content specific to streaming developers, Current has historically been an important event for anyone trying to keep a pulse on what’s happening in the streaming space.  Over 2,000 attendees and lots of new solutions were on display, and the event proved to be a clear look into the current (no pun intended) state of streaming and where it is headed. This blog is for anyone who was interested but unable to attend the conference, or anyone interested in a quick summary of what happened there. I will cover key takeaways from Current 2023 and offer Cloudera’s perspective. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Five Takeaways from Current 2023:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 1- The people have spoken and Apache Flink is the de facto standard for stream processing  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This may seem obvious to many who are already familiar with Flink, but it is worth pointing out. Architecture decisions have long-term effects and an important consideration when choosing a stream processing engine is whether the technology will stagnate or continue to evolve with contributions from the open source community. Will I be able to find developers for this three years from now? The answer from the community is a resounding yes. Flink is here to stay. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It makes perfect sense that Apache Flink has emerged as the standard. Flink was launched in 2015 as the world’s first open source streaming-first distributed stream processing engine and has since grown to rival Spark in terms of popularity. And the layered APIs from low-level operations to high-level abstractions gives Flink appeal to a broad range of users. The adoption of Flink mirrors growth in streaming data volumes and maturity of the streaming market. As organizations shift from the modernization of data-driven applications via Kafka towards delivering real-time &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;insight &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and/or powering smart automated systems, Flink &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At Current, adoption of Flink was a hot topic and many of the vendors (Cloudera included) use Flink as the engine to power their stream processing offerings as well.  Use cases such as fraud monitoring, real-time supply chain insight, IoT-enabled fleet operations, real-time customer intent, and modernizing analytics pipelines are driving development activity. The value of consolidating different processing frameworks onto a single comprehensive framework to minimize technical overhead and maintain innovation speed is well understood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The big announcement everyone was waiting for was the unveiling of Apache Flink in Confluent Cloud. The actual unveiling was a bit underwhelming as the SQL console left a lot to be desired, and outside of serverless auto-scaling functionality there was no “wow” factor. As of this writing, the product is still not GA and will not be made available on-prem, but the unveiling is still important due to the sheer size of the Confluent user base. Adoption will follow, and it’s safe to say that we have passed the tipping point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Flink is the future of streaming.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera’s perspective: Cloudera saw the increasing volumes of data our customers were moving via streams early on. They were suffering rising costs and were struggling to provide real-time insight to demanding stakeholders. So we bet big on Flink in 2020 and started developing tooling to bring it to the enterprise, and have a mature Flink product used by customers in banking, telco, manufacturing, and IT.  kSQLdb, Spark Structured Streaming, and other proprietary approaches that fall short of the truly open and distributed stateful stream processing capabilities that Flink brings to the table will likely decelerate.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2- But there is an intriguing new category of competitor emerging, the “streaming database”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There are a handful of vendors positioning streaming databases as an alternative to Flink for stream processing. Their core value proposition is that streaming databases are inherently faster than Flink due to in-memory processing and state management. This makes sense in theory, but there are pretty wild claims out there as far as just how much&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;faster they are, and with a lack of independent benchmarks in the industry a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted. But the tech is interesting and the allure of DB tooling that can “do-it-all” is strong. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera’s perspective: There is much value to be captured by bringing real-time processing capabilities to streaming architectures. Kafka-centric approaches leave a lot to be desired, most notably operational complexity and difficulty integrating batch data, so there is certainly a gap to be filled. Real-time databases have their place in the streaming ecosystem, but that place is in publishing and making the result sets widely available after a highly scalable engine like Flink has processed the data. Cloudera does this via materialized views that are accessible via API. Also, why solve for connectivity and data distribution again if it’s already solved for? How long does streaming data live inside the database and what happens when it expires? Is this yet another database? What about data lock-in? With highly interdependent capabilities, how difficult will it be to make modifications as business and data requirements evolve?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This class of technologies is very interesting, but still new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“wait and see” is perhaps sage advice.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3- Change data capture is red hot and Debezium is the de facto standard in this space &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Judging by the sheer number of questions from the audience about CDC in general and Debezium specifically, it’s safe to say that Debezium has become for CDC what Flink is for stream processing. It makes perfect sense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;similar to Flink, Debezium is an open source distributed service frequently used with Kafka to extend the value of streaming and capture new use cases. Debezium works by continuously reading the change logs of popular databases and publishing to Kafka topics, effectively transforming legacy batch systems into rich streams of data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Debezium does have certain complexities of course, namely resource management and schema evolution. But there is much value to be captured here.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera perspective: Data freshness matters. It’s difficult to imagine a use case where fresher data isn’t inherently better data. Change Data Capture is an important part of the streaming ecosystem. Cloudera supports Debezium connectors for Kconnect and Flink and will soon release a NiFi processor as well, giving users fine grain control over data distribution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4- Tooling for the Kafka ecosystem is improving &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It’s no secret that Kafka deployments can be quite complex. Setting up clusters, monitoring and managing brokers, partitions, and topics, handling message ordering, exactly once guarantees, schema evolution and security: these all add up to operational overhead. Data lineage and debugging can be a nightmare to unravel. As the streaming space grows in maturity one thing that stood out is the improved tooling in the space. Confluent’s future vision for the data portal is a great example of the effort to provide better tooling and smoother user experience around discoverability and governance. Many vendors are providing enhanced tooling to provide observability and improve performance or to extend the ecosystem by integrating other frameworks such as MQTT and Pulsar.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera perspective: Cloudera began providing support and building tooling for the Kafka ecosystem in 2015 and has developed stable enterprise solutions. The Streams Messaging Manager tool is included in our free community edition of Cloudera Streams Processing. Furthermore, Cloudera SDX provides an integrated set of security and governance tools across the entire data lifecycle, including streaming. The Kafka platform shifting from Zookeeper to Kraft as is a huge relief for anyone managing Kafka operations. KRaft is already in tech preview for our next release.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For these reasons and more, IBM recently chose Cloudera as strategic Kafka partner of choice to bring cost efficient, scalable solutions to our enterprise customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/ibm-technology-chooses-cloudera-as-its-preferred-partner-for-addressing-real-time-data-movement-using-kafka/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;https://blog.cloudera.com/ibm-technology-chooses-cloudera-as-its-preferred-partner-for-addressing-real-time-data-movement-using-kafka/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- There is still room for growth and maturation in the streaming space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;While adoption of streaming technologies has steadily increased, the average streaming maturity level is still in the early stages. Streaming maturity is not about simply streaming more data; it’s about weaving streaming data more deeply into operations to drive real-time utilization across the enterprise. The number of use cases supported by a single Kafka topic is a better indicator than a raw measure of volume like events per second. Surprisingly few users had multiple use cases for most of their Kafka topics. Another hallmark of streaming maturity is the efficiency of the entire system in terms of resource utilization and ease of developing or modifying new use cases. Real-time processing can significantly reduce the volume of data in the stream and that’s a good thing. The majority of data streamers are just beginning to experiment here.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;More forward-looking talks focused on expanding the impact of streaming data.  Real-time anomaly detection and other time series operations on event streams. Operationalizing python for real-time ML pipelines was a hot topic. Others focused on the big picture efficiency, looking for ways to reduce load on Kafka by integrating with Apache Pinot for example (link below to an NYC-based Meetup on this topic). There was conspicuously little content specific to generative AI, which was a bit surprising given the attention the industry at large has given the topic in 2023. Streaming data absolutely has a tremendous role to play in generative AI, in fine tuning foundational models, optimizing prompts, contextualizing and augmenting outputs, etc. Stay tuned for plenty more on that topic!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera perspective:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Data streams are part of a much broader data lifecycle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kafka can’t do it all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Kafka shines when utilized as the real-time bus for application integration and as the message buffer for analytics workflows. When stretched beyond those core capabilities however, it becomes overly complex and carries significant technical overhead. That’s why a complete approach to streaming is needed. An efficient and scalable streaming architecture should be simple yet complete with tooling to address continuous iterative development cycles.  That includes first class support for data distribution (&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/moving-enterprise-data-from-anywhere-to-any-system-made-easy/"&gt;aka universal data distribution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;), edge data capture, stream filtering, independently modifiable stream processing that is accessible to analysts, and integration with data at rest for low cost accessible storage. Lastly, real-time processing and movement of multi structured data including prompts and embeddings is critical for harnessing the transformative power of AI.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stay Motivated When Working on a Difficult Story</title>
      <link>https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/10/17/motivated-difficult-story/</link>
      <description>**关键词**: 问题解决, 进展追踪, 工作切换, 伙伴合作, 激励方法

**大纲**:
- 追踪进展：记录工作的进展情况，避免感觉停滞不前
- 工作切换：在不同任务之间切换，避免对单一任务过度投入
- 休息放松：暂时放下长期困扰的任务，休息一天后重新开始可能有新的想法
- 伙伴合作：与其他开发人员一起工作，获得新的观点和避免枯燥感
- 寻找激励方法：通过以上方法使自己保持积极状态

**总结**:
当我们在解决一个看似轻而易举的问题时，常常会遇到困境。需求不断变化，问题复杂度超出预期，这些原因都可能让我们感到沮丧。为了保持动力，有几个方法可以尝试。首先，追踪进展，记录工作的进展情况，避免感觉停滞不前。其次，可以在不同任务之间切换，避免对单一任务过度投入，从而获得一些小的成功，恢复工作的积极性。另外，对于没有时间限制的任务，可以暂时搁置一天，然后再回来，也许会有一些新的思路。此外，可以邀请其他开发人员合作，获得新的观点和避免枯燥感。最后，寻找适合自己的激励方法，通过以上方法保持积极状态。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;It happens to all of us. We start working on a story that seems like it should be a breeze, but we quickly get a dose of reality. Maybe some requirements keep changing. Maybe there&amp;#8217;s more heavy factoring than expected. Whatever the reason, it can feel demoralizing to work on a problem that might feel ever-growing. Here are some tips to stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep track of your progress.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most demotivating parts of working on a problem that drags on is feeling like you’re not moving forward. It can feel sometimes as though success with software is defined by the number of &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/12/16/writing-good-stories/"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; completed. When one story goes on forever, it can feel like you’re not accomplishing enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the time every few hours to write a brief note about what you’ve done. Reminding yourself that you have done measurable work can help you feel less stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Switch chunks of work.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve spent a lot of time working on one chunk of the story and you’re starting to struggle (or maybe you&amp;#8217;re just getting bored). It’s okay to put your fears about &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/03/24/reduce-context-switching/"&gt;context switching&lt;/a&gt; aside and jump over to another chunk. There’s no use spinning your wheels on one subtask when you could knock out some other bits. A few small successes will also get you back into a productive mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the story you’re working on isn’t time-sensitive, it can sometimes help to take a break from it. Put the entire story on the back burner for a day. When you come back to it, you may have some fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pair frequently.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending a long time on a single piece of work can cause feelings of siloing. It can be useful to bring in other developers to work with you on a chunk of work. This has practical benefits, like new perspectives. Maybe more importantly in this situation, it helps with &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/04/11/strategies-stay-motiviated-when-bored/"&gt;boredom&lt;/a&gt;. Pairing frequently will keep you focused and moving toward finishing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

- 文档团队的工作过程和贡献
- 在WordCamps中的参与和贡献
- 对WordPress社区的思考和感悟

**总结：**
本文讲述了Leonardus Nugraha（Leo）是Hostinger公司WordPress类别的内容专家，他通过个人经历介绍了他是如何进入WordPress世界并成为其中文档团队的一员的。Leo对WordPress的热爱使得他不仅仅写作关于WordPress的文章，还亲自深入参与了文档团队的工作，贡献自己的力量。作为文档团队成员，Leo通过学习文档团队的GitHub问题和参与团队会议的方式，为WordPress的终端用户和开发者撰写了包括技术指南、支持指南和自定义等多个方面的文档。此外，Leo还积极参与了WordCamps活动，不仅以志愿者的身份参与其中，还担任摄影师记录活动的精彩瞬间。通过在WordPress社区中的互动和贡献，Leo体验到了全球WordPress社区的热情和活力。在他的眼中，WP社区不仅仅是一个技术平台，更是一个充满人文关怀和激情的大家庭。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/leonnugraha/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Leonardus Nugraha&lt;/a&gt;, or Leo for short, is &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/" rel="follow"&gt;Hostinger&lt;/a&gt;’s own Content Specialist for the WordPress category. Hailing from Bogor, Indonesia, which is known for its lush botanical garden, Leo is drawn to photographing his rich surroundings. But there’s also another thing he enjoys documenting – the advancements of &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-wordpress" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn how Leo entered the world of WordPress and became part of its documentation team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-into-the-business"&gt;Getting Into the Business&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo first dipped his toes into WordPress at university, where he studied business management. During the IT in Business course, he had to create an eCommerce website from scratch. Among the various &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-a-cms/" rel="follow"&gt;content management systems&lt;/a&gt; available, Leo opted for WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That was the first time I learned about website building. We found out how to get a domain and hosting, install WordPress and &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/woocommerce-tutorial" rel="follow"&gt;WooCommerce&lt;/a&gt;, add products, and integrate payment gateways. The experience introduced me to a wider WordPress ecosystem besides the WordPress.com I had known,&amp;#8221; Leo reminisces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though he drifted away from WordPress after the project, this experience came in handy when Leo joined Hostinger as a content writer in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides crafting articles about WordPress, his team uses the CMS for publishing. &amp;#8220;I had to familiarize myself with the nuances of WordPress once more, from content publishing to understanding &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/video/what-is-seo" rel="follow"&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt; intricacies,&amp;#8221; Leo adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2021, his role had evolved, focusing more on WordPress content. This propelled him to dive deeper into the platform&amp;#8217;s technicalities. “I started to learn more about WordPress customization, keeping up with new versions, and following its development,&amp;#8221; he shares.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo&amp;#8217;s educational background, which includes a Master&amp;#8217;s degree in International Business from Monash University Malaysia, also equipped him with key skills in digital marketing for his involvement in a global open-source project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In my major, there was a strong emphasis on collaboration and project management,” he says. &amp;#8220;Collaborating with diverse groups and understanding different cultures during my studies has prepared me for my journey as a content marketer and a WordPress contributor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diving-into-wordpress-documentation"&gt;Diving Into WordPress Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to create good content about a platform, you should use it. While it is true, it wasn’t enough for Leo – he went the extra mile by diving deep into the heart of WordPress and contributing to its &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Documentation team&lt;/a&gt;. His transition from a user to a contributor reflects not only his commitment, but also the open and welcoming nature of the &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wordpress" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spark for this journey was lit shortly after Leo began writing extensively about WordPress. As an open-source platform, WordPress heavily relies on its community of contributors. When the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Five for the Future&lt;/a&gt; initiative surfaced, Hostinger decided to &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/hostinger-international/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;take part in it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My manager asked me if I wanted to participate in this initiative. I was eager to contribute, and since I’m a WordPress content specialist, I naturally gravitated towards the Documentation team,&amp;#8221; Leo says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I began learning about the Documentation team from &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the Contributor Handbook&lt;/a&gt;,” Leo recalls. “It’s pretty challenging at first. But then my manager introduced me to &lt;a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/milana_cap/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Milana Cap&lt;/a&gt;, the Documentation team representative, and she guided me through it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo then took a GitHub issue to learn how to create proper documentation for the first time. It was a new document request, which he found to be enjoyable. “I loved crafting new documents. It’s somehow more exciting than doing updates,” he laughs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leonardus Nugraha and his WordPress Documentation teammates in Community Summit 2023" class="wp-image-5629" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/leo-and-documentation-team-in-community-summit-2023-1024x683.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becoming more engaged in Documentation contribution, Leo started attending the team’s weekly meetings. He’s been volunteering to facilitate the assembly from time to time. He keeps expanding his participation by constantly learning new tasks in the team, such as helping to onboard new contributors in the Documentation table during the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/contributor-day/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Contributor Day&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp US 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s fun to be at the Documentation team’s table during Contributor Day. Besides being able to work in-person with people I normally only interact with on GitHub and Slack, there are lots of cookies to try,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cookies he mentions are the Docs team’s tradition during Contributor Days – Milana brings various cookies to munch together during the event. “In the Docs team’s Slack channel, we usually give kudos – a way to say someone is doing a good job – by giving a cookie emoji. So we bring it to life during Contributor Day at our table. Of course, we share them with other teams as well,” Leo remarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And to answer a common query, Leo clarifies that one doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be a technical expert to contribute to the team. “There are two types of documentation: end-user and developer. For end-user documentation, if you use WordPress and understand its workings, you should be able to write the docs. It&amp;#8217;s basically about guiding other users to navigate inside the platform. However, creating developer documentation needs technical knowledge to a certain extent.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rolling-as-a-documentation-team-member"&gt;Rolling as a Documentation Team Member&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work of WordPress&amp;#8217;s Documentation team involves more processes than solely writing the guidance. “The Docs team aims to ensure that each feature is accurately and comprehensively explained. For example, let’s take &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wordpress-blocks" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress Blocks&lt;/a&gt;. When creating documentation about the feature, we explain what it is and detail how to use its and its features. If any visual representations are available, we will include them in the documentation, so that end-users can understand it better,” Leo explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the process to craft a documentation article that Leo usually goes through:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scour the &lt;a href="https://github.com/WordPress/documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Documentation Team GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for issues you want to work on, then assign yourself to the issue.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Start drafting. You can do it in Google Docs, or directly on the WordPress back end if you have access.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When writing, you can test the feature, but make sure to refer to the GitHub ticket that explains what the feature is.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Once the draft is ready, reviewers will step in to ensure the content aligns with style guides and formatting requirements. They will also make edits if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When it gets reviewed, the documentation can be published.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo also mentions that the Docs team regularly updates the existing documentation. “In every WordPress release, the Documentation release squad will check the existing documentation and see what updates must be made. This applies for both end-user and developer documentation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then explains that these updates usually are made during the &lt;a href="https://theproductmanager.com/topics/software-release-life-cycle/#:~:text=A%20release%20candidate%20(RC)%20is,to%20as%20%E2%80%9CControlled%20Availability%E2%80%9D." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Release Candidate&lt;/a&gt; period. There can also be updates outside the release cycle, if minor changes are applied or any errors found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for now, there are four main categories for end-user documentation on the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordPress Documentation&lt;/a&gt; website – WordPress overview, technical guides, support guides, and customization. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;developer documentation&lt;/a&gt; is categorized based on more specific topics such as code reference, plugins, and the block editor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="the homepage of WordPress Documentation website that shows user documentation" class="wp-image-5630" height="414" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/wordpress-documentation-1024x414.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that developer documentation is different from &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/writing-developer-notes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;developer notes&lt;/a&gt;. Developer documentation covers broader technical aspects of WordPress, such as the best coding practices and how to interact with various APIs. Meanwhile, a developer note contains the details of technical changes in an upcoming WordPress release, and what developers need to know about such changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Leo has never touched on developer documentation, he did work on the developer notes for &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wordpress-6-3-release-leads" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress 6.3&lt;/a&gt;. “I gathered notes about new features, code changes, and its utilization. Then I categorized them, and published them during the release cycle,&amp;#8221; he elaborates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To bring structure and direction, there’s a biweekly meeting within the Docs team. The session involves team updates, work progress, and brainstorming, while the triage meeting focuses on assigning GitHub issues to contributors. “So if there&amp;#8217;s a high priority documentation, or if there are backlogs, we just post in the triage meeting and ask who wants to work on it,” Leo explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then mentions that the Docs team also carries out an online Contributor Day every fourth week of the month. The event comes in the form of a three-hour Zoom session. Leo adds, “It’s an easy entry point for newcomers, and often includes onboarding calls in a separate break room.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-lines-behind-the-lens"&gt;Beyond the Lines, Behind the Lens&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like many WordPress enthusiasts, Leo always looks forward to attending &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/what-is-wordcamp" rel="follow"&gt;WordCamps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My first WordCamp was &lt;a href="https://gresik.wordcamp.org/2022/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp Gresik 2022&lt;/a&gt;, a local WordCamp in Indonesia. There were around 200 attendees, just one conference day and one contributor&amp;#8217;s day. It gave me the idea of what WordCamp is,” Leo recalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At WordCamp Gresik, besides attending presentations, he joined the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Polyglots Team&lt;/a&gt;’s table. “There was no Documentation table, so I thought it would be great to explore other teams,” Leo adds. He unexpectedly became a &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/about/roles-and-capabilities/#general-translation-editor" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;General Translation Editor&lt;/a&gt; there, broadening his contribution horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the things Leo loves the most about WordCamps is the opportunity to network with other WordPress enthusiasts and professionals. As a part of the Hostinger team, he also gets to interact with our &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/wordpress-hosting" rel="follow"&gt;Managed WordPress hosting&lt;/a&gt; customers. &amp;#8220;Engaging with fellow WordPress users and industry people expanded my understanding of the global WordPress community,&amp;#8221; he expresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo also enjoys volunteering for WordCamps, especially as a photographer. &amp;#8220;My first experience volunteering for WordCamp was in &lt;a href="https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp Asia 2023&lt;/a&gt;, where I volunteered as a photographer. I&amp;#8217;ve always had a &lt;a href="https://leoandlens.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;passion for photography&lt;/a&gt;, so this let me merge my hobby and contribution while enjoying the event,&amp;#8221; Leo states.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leonardus Nugraha and Indonesian WordPress community in WordCamp Asia 2023" class="wp-image-5631" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/leo-and-indonesian-wordpress-community-1024x683.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While his strong side is landscape and architecture photography, Leo is fond of capturing candid moments at WordCamps. &amp;#8220;I adore candid shots, people in spontaneous interactions. They capture the WordCamp spirit authentically,&amp;#8221; he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although not an active member of the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/photos/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Photos Team&lt;/a&gt;, Leo has made his mark by uploading some of his photo works to the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/photos/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Photo Directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on WordCamp memories, his thoughts always return to WordCamp Asia&amp;#8217;s first day. &amp;#8220;It was surreal, meeting and connecting with the global WordPress community face-to-face. These interactions, dinners, and after-parties have carved unforgettable memories,&amp;#8221; Leo concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In essence, Leo&amp;#8217;s journey in the WordPress community is not just about contributions. It&amp;#8217;s about connections, passion, and memorable moments that span across continents and pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CDKTF 0.19 adds support for config-driven import and refactoring</title>
      <link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cdktf-0-19-adds-support-for-config-driven-import-and-refactoring</link>
      <description>**关键词：**
- CDK for Terraform (CDKTF)
- config-driven import
- refactoring
- resource migration
- Terraform

**大纲：**
1. CDKTF (CDK for Terraform)简介和目标
2. CDKTF的新功能：支持config-driven import和refactoring
    - 介绍CDKTF v0.19版本的发布
    - config-driven import的两种工作流程
    - refactoring中的resource移动支持
3. 如何尝试CDK for Terraform

**总结：**
CDK for Terraform (CDKTF)旨在简化Terraform的使用，通过支持多种编程语言的配置编写和引入新的功能来实现这一目标。最新版本的CDKTF (CDKTF v0.19)改进了支持config-driven import和refactoring的能力，使得开发人员可以安全地将现有基础架构引入CDKTF项目中，并进行重构操作。通过使用CDKTF，开发人员可以更方便地迁移和管理资源，而不会影响业务连续性。如果想尝试CDK for Terraform，可以查看CDKTF的教程，深入了解CDKTF的文档，并通过讨论论坛与其他用户交流。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mission of CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) is to simplify Terraform adoption. We introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cdk-for-terraform-now-generally-available"&gt;generally available version of CDKTF&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2022,  enabling developers not familiar with HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to write Terraform configurations in their choice of language, including TypeScript, Python, C#, Java, and Go. In July of 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/new-multi-language-docs-simplify-cdk-for-terraform-adoption"&gt;multi-language provider documentation for CDKTF&lt;/a&gt; further simplified infrastructure provisioning by offering provider configuration options and code samples for the programming languages supported by CDKTF, alongside the HCL documentation in the registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working to make CDKTF more powerful by supporting new Terraform features to achieve cost savings and improve security. Up until now, CDKTF had limited support for import and moved blocks, resulting in manual, cumbersome resource migration and refactoring within a CDKTF project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re releasing CDKTF version 0.19, which improves support for &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-5-brings-config-driven-import-and-checks"&gt;config-driven import&lt;/a&gt; and refactoring. This support allows developers to safely move resources and bring existing infrastructure into CDKTF projects with auto-generated code — without jeopardizing business continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Config-driven import support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importing existing infrastructure into a CDKTF project was a manual process until &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-5-brings-config-driven-import-and-checks"&gt;Terraform 1.5 introduced config-driven import&lt;/a&gt; in June. CDKTF v0.19 adds &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf/concepts/resources#importing-resources"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; for config-driven import (which requires Terraform 1.5+) with two workflows, described below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Specify a CDKTF config for a resource and specify where it is currently living:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instantiate an instance of the resource type you want to import, with an empty configuration. Then call the &lt;code&gt;importFrom&lt;/code&gt; method on the resource object, providing the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; present for the resource in the cloud provider:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new S3Bucket(this, "bucket", {}).importFrom("id-in-cloud-provider")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;When running a &lt;code&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;, you will get a message saying that your resource is going to be imported. Once you run &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;, you can remove the &lt;code&gt;importFrom&lt;/code&gt; call and the resource will now be managed by CDKTF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Generate configuration for an existing resource&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to generate configuration for an imported resource, you can use the static method &lt;code&gt;generateConfigForImport&lt;/code&gt; by specifying the type of a resource and its resource ID. When you run a plan, Terraform will generate HCL config for the resource and CDKTF will convert it to your language of choice: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;S3Bucket.generateConfigForImport(this, "bucket", "id-in-cloud-provider");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Resource refactoring with moved block support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ID of a resource is changed — for example, by refactoring it into a nested construct — destroying and recreating the resource is the default behavior of Terraform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the new &lt;code&gt;moveTo&lt;/code&gt; method lets you refactor code without losing the state or destroying and recreating the resources being moved. This is especially important when working in a production environment where you might want to restructure your code but can't afford service downtime or data loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;moveTo&lt;/code&gt; function is available on all resources and is used for relocating a resource to the location specified by the string target. To set the string target for a resource, use the &lt;code&gt;addMoveTarget&lt;/code&gt; function present on the resource to move to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new S3Bucket(this, "test-bucket-move-to", {
	bucket: "move-bucket-name",
}).addMoveTarget("move-s3");

new S3Bucket(this, "test-bucket-move-from", {
	bucket: "move-bucket-name",
}).moveTo("move-s3");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try CDK for Terraform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to the project, these &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf"&gt;tutorials for CDKTF&lt;/a&gt; are the best way to get started. You can dive deeper into our documentation with this &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf"&gt;overview of CDKTF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CodeSOD: Taking the Temperature</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/taking-the-temperature</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. TA&lt;/strong&gt; inherited some C# code that communicates with a humidity and a temperature sensor. Each sensor logs a series of datapoints as they run, and can provide them as an array of data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;DataPoint[] humidDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-literal"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;;  
DataPoint[] tempDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-literal"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// For now,  determine if this is the primary or secondary sensor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (sensorType == (&lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;)SensorTypeID.HUMIDITY)
{
    &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// create the array size then get the data&lt;/span&gt;
    humidDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataPoint[ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().Count];
    humidDataPointArray = ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().ToArray();
}
&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
{
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (sensorNum == &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
    {
        &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// create the array size then get the data&lt;/span&gt;
        tempDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataPoint[((SingleSensorTemptale)ttData).PrimarySensorData.GetDataPoints().Count];
        tempDataPointArray = ((SingleSensorTemptale)ttData).PrimarySensorData.GetDataPoints().ToArray();
    }
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    {
        &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// create the array size then get the data&lt;/span&gt;
        tempDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataPoint[ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().Count];
        tempDataPointArray = ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().ToArray();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts out okay. We create the arrays to hold the data. Then we check the &lt;code&gt;sensorType&lt;/code&gt; against an enum. And that's where things start to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initialize an empty array that's the same size as the number of data points, then we set that array equal to the array of data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm stuck trying to figure out if this is someone with no real experience, or a C programmer trying to migrate from pointers to references. Since C# is uses references, we don't need that &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;- we can just set &lt;code&gt;humidPointsArray&lt;/code&gt; equal to the result of the function call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the result of the function call- it looks like &lt;code&gt;GetDataPoints()&lt;/code&gt; returns a C# enumerable type. Which implies there's really no good reason to convert it into an array. I can't be certain about that, maybe they really need the array, but I suspect that's not the case- and it's a best practice in C# to use more abstract interfaces for collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; inside of it, instead of an &lt;code&gt;else if&lt;/code&gt;. This second condition eschews the lovely enum we used before, and just checks &lt;code&gt;sensorNum == 1&lt;/code&gt;. Then we repeat the same unnecessary allocation, with the bonus misspelling of &lt;code&gt;SingleSensorTemptale&lt;/code&gt;, which is certain never to give any future developer problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a bonus, this code runs in a tight loop, ensuring the garbage collector gets lots of practice cleaning up memory we never needed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: Honestly, it's the switch from enum to not enum that bothers me the most --&gt;

But how exactly should these services be &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/self-service-is-key-for-api-monetization/"&gt;monetized&lt;/a&gt;? There is an emerging art around knowing how to charge for API calls and how to construct a viable, scalable operational process to support the API business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_16975" style="width: 190px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Matt-Tanner-Moesif" class=" wp-image-16975" height="180" src="https://nordicapis.com/wp-content/uploads/Matt-Tanner-Moesif.jpeg" width="180" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-16975"&gt;At Platform Summit 2023, Matt Tanner will dive deep into strategies for building your API monetization stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/speakers/matt-tanner/"&gt;Matt Tanner&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Developer Relations at Moesif, many companies are seeking to drive more revenue amid a slimmer economy and are turning to APIs as a new avenue for growth. Monetizing valuable proprietary services and data, for instance, is an exciting frontier, but it requires the &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/10-helpful-api-monetization-tools/"&gt;right technology stack&lt;/a&gt; to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/events/platform-summit-2023/"&gt;Platform Summit 2023&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;re chatting with key speakers to learn what they&amp;#8217;re working on and to get more background on their upcoming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt has worked as a developer, tech lead, and architect for some of Canada&amp;#8217;s largest financial institutions and insurers. At Moesif, he&amp;#8217;s been helping developers and product managers understand and use API analytics and new monetization tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up with Matt to dig into API monetization, the theme of his upcoming deep dive on &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/sessions/deep-dive-building-an-api-monetization-stack/"&gt;building an API monetization stack&lt;/a&gt; — a presentation built on two years of working heavily within the API monetization space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for the interview with Matt below, and be sure to attend the &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/events/platform-summit-2023/"&gt;Platform Summit 2023&lt;/a&gt; for more discussion on this topic and plenty of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is API monetization trending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many businesses are now realizing that APIs have a default ability to create a new stream of revenue. Especially with the current state of the economy here in the US and Canada, organizations are looking for any place possible to drive revenue. Certain technologies have also recently emerged which allow API monetization to be implemented more easily. This means that businesses considering it on their 3-5-year roadmap can now implement it much more quickly. This is a key driver I&amp;#8217;ve seen as well that has led to this uptick in API monetization popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What types of APIs can or should be monetized?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two factors to consider: does the API deliver a valuable service, and are people willing to pay for that? A good example I like to use is for a credit score API. Let&amp;#8217;s say I&amp;#8217;m a fintech company, and I have built an API that can query multiple credit bureaus and aggregate an overall credit score. This API&amp;#8217;s value proposition is that it can retrieve a credit score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question is, &amp;#8220;Do other businesses also need this?&amp;#8221;. In this case, the answer is absolutely! So, this would be a good example of an easily monetizable API (a term I have apparently just made up). Most companies have a really good idea of their most valuable proprietary APIs — they just need to ask who else may be willing to pay to use that service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should prospective API providers consider when choosing their monetization model? (Transaction volume, reve share, data volume, user-centric, resource, etc.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think offering multiple models is the best, or at least having the capability to do so. It really depends on the overall business model. For instance, it makes sense to monetize a payment processing API based on a revenue share/percentage model, such as charging 2% per transaction. In this case, it would likely not make sense to charge per API call or per user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, understanding what the API does and the most efficient way to charge for it helps uncover which model is best. Often, the limitation on monetization comes from the technology side. An example would be if you wanted to charge based on resource usage, but your metering solution only counts per API call. Then, you&amp;#8217;ll be limited to that one model. Finding the right tech will be the biggest hurdle to actually supporting different monetization models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What goes into constructing an API monetization stack? What are the operational processes to consider?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime you build something, you always want to look at what your landscape already includes. Understand the capabilities of your API gateway (if using one), what limitations a billing provider may have, etc. Once you know what you have, you can figure out what you can build with it. That will help you establish the parameters of what&amp;#8217;s possible. In an ideal world, though, you&amp;#8217;d first come up with your exact business cases, find the tech to facilitate that functionality, and then implement it from a clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, as we know, that doesn&amp;#8217;t tend to happen. Establish what you need a system to do that will monetize your APIs, then figure out the limitations (ones you can change and those that are immovable), and then implement. It sounds pretty straightforward, but you&amp;#8217;d be surprised how many people get 90% of the way there and then realize they #1 can&amp;#8217;t use the tech they require or #2 don&amp;#8217;t realize the limitations of the tech they&amp;#8217;ve chosen to build with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any anti-patterns you&amp;#8217;ve witnessed when it comes to monetizing APIs in practice? How about best practices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I&amp;#8217;ve seen is that people tend to think of monetization in two ways. The first would be to use a subscription model, and the second is to just use a &amp;#8220;charge per API call approach&amp;#8221;. These are two ways to monetize APIs. However, they don&amp;#8217;t necessarily mean you&amp;#8217;re delivering value to a customer. And most importantly, it also may mean that you are leaving potential revenue on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with defaulting to a subscription-based model is that aligning value is hard. If I charge $5k per month for API access, regardless of how many API calls or resources are used, then those making the most use of the service will likely be getting the highest while those making the least use will see a major value discrepancy. Tiers can help to offset this disparity but still leave a value gap most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A way around this is to charge based on usage, particularly per API call. With usage-based pricing, you can get closer to equal value by charging for exact use. The issue is that not every API call is equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to our payment processing API example, if I process a $2 payment through the API vs a $2000 payment, but I&amp;#8217;m paying the same amount per API call/transaction, the API call for the lower amount may have a value issue that pops up. If the price per API call was $1, then they are looking at a 50% fee versus a $1 charge against the $2000 payment, where the fee is substantially lower compared to the amount of money transacted. In this case, you&amp;#8217;d want to pick the model that is fair to customers and drives the most revenue internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For best practices, putting my software architect hat on, I suggest questioning every single scenario and mapping out edge cases. Most platforms that help with monetization can do the simple stuff well, but the edge cases become infinitely more complex to handle correctly. Since every API monetization initiative will be pretty custom, good planning is the key to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you looking forward to the Platform Summit 2023?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very excited to see the different opinions and folks within the API community. I&amp;#8217;m also excited on a personal level to visit Sweden for the first time. I think the collective knowledge that will be at this conference will give me some great insights, and I&amp;#8217;m also excited to share my knowledge with others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope attendees will take away from your talk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope attendees will see that API monetization is hard but worth it. Many companies I talk to struggle to figure out where to start. This talk will give them a solid foundation of the business fundamentals and all of the technical considerations. Hopefully, our learnings at Moesif over the last two years will benefit others as they strive to monetize their APIs effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This solution does not &amp;quot;mimic&amp;quot; the Cypress Cloud API, thus it should not be banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;☢️ If Cypress team DOES block &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split"&gt;cypress-split&lt;/a&gt; plugin, then I will have no choice but to block all my Cypress plugins (I have written 75+ Cypress plugins) if Cypress is run with &lt;code&gt;--record&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All we need to do to use this plugin is to add it to the &lt;code&gt;setupNodeEvents&lt;/code&gt; callback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight js"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;cypress.config.mjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#123; defineConfig &amp;#125; &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#x27;cypress&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; cypressSplit &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#x27;cypress-split&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="variable language_"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="property"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="title function_"&gt;defineConfig&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;e2e&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// baseUrl, etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;supportFile&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="literal"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;fixturesFolder&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="literal"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="title function_"&gt;setupNodeEvents&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="params"&gt;on, config&lt;/span&gt;) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;      &lt;span class="title function_"&gt;cypressSplit&lt;/span&gt;(on, config)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;      &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// IMPORTANT: return the config object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;      &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &amp;#125;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &amp;#125;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&amp;#125;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specs were split purely based on their names in the list, which can create unbalanced lists for machines. For example, let's take a project with five specs split across two machines. The first run splits the specs alphabetically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alphabetical spec timings on two machines" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/t1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is our GitHub Actions workflow file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/ci.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;

In this examples I am using version v1 the &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ughh, there is a spec &lt;code&gt;spec-d.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; that is much longer than others, and it makes the second machine take much longer. While the second machine is running &lt;code&gt;spec-d.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;spec-e.cy.js&lt;/code&gt;, the first machine is idle. It would be better to shift the spec &lt;code&gt;spec-e.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; to the first machine. Then we would save 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="timings"&gt;Timings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's tell &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; to split specs based on previous run timings. Unfortunately, we do not have 3rd party service to keep track of spec timings, thus we need to do it ourselves. Let's set another environment variable &lt;code&gt;SPLIT_FILE&lt;/code&gt; on the test runners. Right now, it points at a non-existent file &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; in the root folder of the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/ci.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="string"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="bullet"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;Cypress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;tests&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;🧪&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;# https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;uses:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;cypress-io/github-action@v6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;with:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;# we don&amp;#x27;t need Cypress own runner summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;publish-summary:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="literal"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;env:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;SPLIT:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;$&amp;#123;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;strategy.job-total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;SPLIT_INDEX:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;$&amp;#123;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;strategy.job-index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;SPLIT_FILE:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#x27;timings.json&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's run the workflow again. The &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; file is not found yet, no big deal. The specs are split alphabetically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;cypress-split: there are 5 found specs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;cypress-split: chunk 1 of 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;cypress-split: Could not split specs by duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;ENOENT: no such file or directory, open &amp;#x27;timings.json&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;cypress-split: splitting as is by name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;k  spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;-  ------------------------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1  cypress/e2e/spec-a.cy.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2  cypress/e2e/spec-b.cy.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3  cypress/e2e/spec-c.cy.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the run, the plugin prints JSON object with spec durations for the current machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Spec timings from the first machine" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/t2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second machine prints its timings JSON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Spec timings from the second machine" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/t3.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; the timings are logged to the terminal and saved in the local file on CI. Thus at the end of the test-run each machine has its own uncommitted &lt;code&gt;SPLIT_FILE&lt;/code&gt; file on disk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You manually copy &amp;#x2f; paste both timings and merge them into a single &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt;

splits the specs based on durations. The first machine runs only the spec &lt;code&gt;cypress/e2e/spec-d.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; which takes by itself 60 seconds. The second machine runs the rest of the specs that together take up 40 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Specs split based on timings" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/t4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice. The spec split implementation can be found in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split/blob/main/src/timings.js"&gt;src&amp;#x2f;timings.js&lt;/a&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; plugin. Right now it is a simple greedy algorithm, but it seems to work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="updating-timingsjson-file-single-ci-job"&gt;Updating timings.json file: single CI job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If specs change or new specs are added, the timings file becomes out-of-date. I have a couple of ideas how to update it periodically without relying on 3rd party service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; if the spec is new and does not have duration in the timings file yet, the split algorithm assigns it an average duration of all existing specs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first strategy is to use a single long CI job that runs all specs and then commits the updated &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; file. It is very easy to commit changed files when using GitHub Actions CI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/nightly.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;

If there are any changes to the timings, the &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; file is committed and pushed to the repository using the wonderful reusable GitHub Action &lt;a href="https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action"&gt;stefanzweifel&amp;#x2f;git-auto-commit-action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; writes new timings file only if there are new specs or any durations are off by more than 10% from the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="updating-timingsjson-file-merge-timings"&gt;Updating timings.json file: merge timings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of running a single job with all specs to update the timings file, we can use my &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; workflow from &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows"&gt;cypress-workflows&lt;/a&gt; repo. It works with &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; alias &lt;code&gt;cypress-split-merge&lt;/code&gt; to merge downloaded timings files from parallel runs and output a single combined JSON as a GitHub Actions output. Here is an example workflow from &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split-timings-example"&gt;cypress-split-timings-example&lt;/a&gt; repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/split.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;

expands into multiple jobs. At the end, the &lt;code&gt;merge-split-timings&lt;/code&gt; job creates the &lt;code&gt;merged-timings&lt;/code&gt; output with all combined timings. We can commit the timings into the repo to be used for next CI run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Showing merged timings" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/t5.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any problems using &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split"&gt;cypress-split&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows"&gt;cypress-workflows&lt;/a&gt; do not hesitate opening a GitHub issue.

      <title>NWRUG's October 2023 Meeting (19 October)</title>
      <link>https://thoughtbot.com/blog/nwrug-s-october-2023-meeting-19-october</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It will soon be NWRUG&amp;rsquo;s October 2023 meet-up on Thursday, 19 October, at
IntelliCentrics UK&amp;rsquo;s offices. To attend, please secure a spot on &lt;a href="https://www.tickettailor.com/events/nwrug/1028423"&gt;their Ticket
Tailor page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, thoughtbot&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://ruby.social/@slickepinne"&gt;Svenja Schäfer&lt;/a&gt; will be giving a remote talk called
&amp;ldquo;How regular expressions made my dog less reactive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it: Regular Expressions are intimidating. As soon as we know we
have to deal with them, we open StackOverflow. Someone has the answer. We
might not know if it’s correct, but at least we can write some tests around
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I tell you, that my dog, Hugo, with serious fear for everything
unknown, moving or not moving, big or small, became less reactive – with the
help of regular expressions? This talk will give you the answer and a
guideline to understand regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read &lt;a href="https://nwrug.org/code-of-conduct"&gt;their code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://nwrug.org/events/october-2023-svenja-schafer"&gt;full event details&lt;/a&gt; are available on
the NWRUG website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are always looking for people to give talks in person or via The Internet.
Be the change you want to see, and &lt;a href="mailto:info@nwrug.org"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

2. S3 origin
3. CloudFront
4. Terraform
5. 功能代码

**大纲：**

- 引言
- 实现使用S3 origin的方法
- 使用CloudFront进行改进并解决问题
- 实现CloudFront解决方案的步骤
- CloudFront解决方案的不足之处

**总结：**

这篇文章讨论了如何通过Web URL提供静态文件以传达环境信息给客户端。作者提到了使用S3 origin和Terraform来实现这一目标的方法。然后，作者介绍了如何通过使用CloudFront和功能代码来改进这个解决方案，并解决了资源使用的问题。最后，作者讨论了使用CloudFront解决方案的一些不足之处，如部署周期、函数代码限制和更改函数代码的问题。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-return-a-static-file-with-a-cloudfront-function/"&gt;(Read this article on the blog)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 id="environment-information"&gt;Environment information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I need to make a small static file available via a web URL. For example, to communicate pieces of information about the environment to clients, such
as the Cognito login URL they need to use, I make a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;/config.mjs&lt;/code&gt; or similar with that information. The client then knows where to find this information and can fetch it when it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="internal_link_box my-5 p-3 pt-3 position-relative"&gt;
          &lt;div class="box-title text-monospace position-absolute py-1 px-3"&gt;
            Related
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
              &lt;div class="row"&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-md-5 box-image mb-3"&gt;
                  &lt;a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-provide-information-about-the-backend-environment-to-frontend-clients/"&gt; 
                    
                    &lt;img class="w-100 h-100 img-bordered" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/53a1c4-5b85fa1c576acf6d90441683cf40b5f7ad3e1afe2c7b864efb05242a4de65be7.jpg" /&gt;
                  &lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-md-7"&gt;
                  &lt;div class="h4 box-element-title mt-0 mb-0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-provide-information-about-the-backend-environment-to-frontend-clients/"&gt;How to provide information about the backend environment to frontend clients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class="box-element-excerpt mt-2"&gt;
                    Environment variable-like functionality for client applications
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement this, I usually opt for an S3 origin with a single file deployed with Terraform, as described in the linked article. While this setup works well, I
started thinking whether I could solve the same problem with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudFront supports running arbitrary code for client requests and they can also return a static response without going to the origin. This makes a suitable
solution for this problem: since the function code is generated by Terraform it can include not just static data but also information about resources in the
stack. This makes this solution a valid alternative to communicate environment data to clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="implementation"&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down the different parts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, write the function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-terraform highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_cloudfront_function"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"static_file"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"static_file-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"cloudfront-js-1.0"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;
function handler(event) {
	return {
		statusCode: 200,
		statusDescription: "OK",
		body: {
			encoding: "base64",
			data: "${base64encode(trimspace(&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOT
This is a response defined in Terraform.
It can even include dynamic values: ${aws_lambda_function.tester.arn}
EOT
			))}"
		}
	}
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function returns a status code (200), a description (“OK”), and a body. The body then is encoded in Base64 to avoid any escaping issues and the data uses
Terraform’s &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;base64encode&lt;/code&gt; function with the HEREDOC syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value defined here is returned to the clients as-is and Terraform can insert data that is available during the deployment. In the above example, it includes
the ARN of a Lambda function, but it can equally be a Cognito Client ID, an invoke URL, or anything else the clients might need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no origin that CloudFront will contact, it is still a required element. To make sure there is an error in case it tries to contact it, the
special &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;.invalid&lt;/code&gt; domain can be used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-terraform highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;domain_name&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"invalid.invalid"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin_id&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"invalid"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;custom_origin_config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;http_port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https_port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;443&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin_protocol_policy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"http-only"&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin_ssl_protocols&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"TLSv1.2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache behavior then defines the path pattern for the file and configures the function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-terraform highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ordered_cache_behavior&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path_pattern&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/static_file"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target_origin_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"invalid"&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;function_association&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event_type&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"viewer-request"&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;function_arn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_cloudfront_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;static_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arn&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending a request to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;/static_file&lt;/code&gt; then returns the contents defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="disadvantages"&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a more optimized solution compared to the S3 file-based one there are a few drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it is easier to end up with a deployment cycle as the CloudFront distribution depends on the function. For example, if a Cognito Client ID is included in
the returned data while the Cognito Client defines the CloudFront domain as an allowed callback URL then Terraform can’t deploy the stack. To deploy the
function, it needs the Client ID. But to create the Cognito Client, it needs the CloudFront distribution. But the distribution needs the function before it can
be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a problem with the S3-based solution as the file can be added last when all the other resources are already created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, it works only for small file. CloudFront functions &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-functions"&gt;have a
limit&lt;/a&gt; of 10KB of function code, so anything that it
returns must fit in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, changing the function code is problematic. Terraform tries to destroy the old one first before creating the new one. This looks like a problem with
the Terraform provider, so probably it will be fixed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    - 日常工作流程
    - 借助他人的技能和经验

    - 对团队自主权的需求
    - 良好的沟通
4. Ensemble programming的总结

**总结：**
Ensemble programming是一种团队合作的软件开发方法，通过共享代码拥有权、知识分享和协作编程来实现团队成员之间的协作。它能够提高团队的工作效率和产出，并带来诸多优势，如更快的新人适应期、全员参与感和优化解决方案的能力。然而，它也存在挑战，如需要快速决策、难以深入研究感兴趣的领域和工作速度相对较慢。为了确保成功，团队需要关注参与度、日常工作流程、借用他人的技能和经验、减轻心理负担、知识分享、自主权和良好的沟通。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p class="txt-2xl font-semibold"&gt;Ensemble programming is a way for teams of developers to collaborate in real-time. A group usually consists of three to five developers. The group performs collaborative coding, all focusing on a single task at a time and benefits from collective knowledge to find the optimal working solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="body"&gt;I recently had the opportunity to perform software development in an ensemble and the experience helped me identify needs that were important for any type of team to flourish and excel. If this sounds like something that your team may benefit from, read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Our Implementation of Ensemble Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On this client, our team of five developers performed driver-navigator in rotations. One person is designated the initial driver, shares their screen, and implements the code changes directed by the navigator for a set period of time. Once that period of time is up, the driver becomes the next navigator. Another person is chosen as the driver and the process repeats until everyone has their turn. Then the rotation starts again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Each navigator is free to decide the direction for the next set of code changes, which sometimes picks up the changes from the previous navigator or changes directions completely, such as performing a refactor. The navigator gains help from the other team members on the call, if needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once a week, we perform spikes, where we could spend the afternoon researching a new tool, library, or idea that benefited the client in some way and then present the information to the team the next morning. If the team deemed the work beneficial, any code changes would require integration into the code base via ensemble programming. No code changes resulting from solo work were allowed to be merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Benefits of Ensemble Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Pooling knowledge means that teams find the optimal solution from the start. No time is wasted trying something new, submitting a PR, and then finding out that the team doesn’t agree with that implementation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;New team members have quick ramp up time. Because everyone is working together, new team members don’t need to spend time trying to understand a process before they can get started. They simply listen, learn, and participate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Everyone feels involved. I felt immediately part of the team from day one. It was very clear that we were all contributing, working together, and making progress — together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Challenges of Ensemble Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When making decisions, you need to respond very quickly. Some people take time to process information and come up with a valid counterargument. If you are in your head trying to understand an idea, it is quite possible the team has already decided and moved on before you chime in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Having everyone work together all the time means it is challenging to deep dive into an area that interests you. This is especially true for people who learn better by being hands-on-keyboard. I personally like to experiment and try different things to get a deeper understanding of how and why something works. There isn’t time for this during an ensemble. You can propose an idea but you decide on consensus and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Programming feels very slow. Everyone working together all the time means that you only work on one thing at a time. You can slice features into smaller slices to get things out faster, but they are still just smaller slices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;The 7 Needs of Successful Teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any programming approach, it's important to adapt to the team's needs. Here are some learnings our team took away from ensemble programming that can be applied to other teams or even other delivery approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;1. The Need for Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After the first week of ensemble, I felt extremely exhausted. As someone with introverted tendencies, the sheer amount of brain power and socializing skills I needed to exude to listen to four other people on a call for seven hours every day was more than I thought I could muster. Despite this challenge, I made sure to listen to every single person on the call, their insights, their coding techniques, and their questions. I also made sure to stay engaged as much as possible. I participated in the conversations, asked questions when I was confused and provided suggestions when people got stuck, even when I didn’t know the code base very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: Being engaged reduces ramp up time, helps to understand the culture and allows you to contribute to the work quickly. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;2. The Need for Routine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After a few weeks of ensemble, I noticed that some of the team members, including myself, were showing signs of burnout. It was hard for me to understand the task at hand, I was dreading the rest of the afternoon, and people who were neither driving nor navigating on the call were completely disengaged from the conversation. After some self-reflection and observation, I realized the source of the exhaustion. We would work for hours at a time, with no breaks, and blow past lunch without even realizing it. I can get hangry with the best of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After some discussions with the team, we tried a few different techniques to alleviate this issue. I found that the best version of the ensemble that our team practiced was by applying the pomodoro technique to our workflow. We would code for 50 minutes, take a 10-minute break, stop at noon for lunch (or as close to noon as possible), and then end the day on time. This became a more sustainable pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing a routine of taking breaks before exhaustion ensures the team has energy to keep going without compromising on pace or progress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;3. The Need to Phone a Friend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the benefits of ensemble programming is the ability to tap into the skillsets of the experts on your team. For example, we would have to create a new AWS lambda, or modify a Dynamo db schema, or figure out some strange UI refresh issue in our React Typescript front end. In all these cases, I never hesitated to navigate an issue that I was completely unfamiliar with because I had the ability to shoulder tap anyone on the team that was more familiar with the technology than I was. I would be in the middle of navigating a feature and pause to ask the Lambda expert what was the best AWS command to use, the Typescript expert why I couldn’t get something to compile or the Jest expert why my mock wasn’t working. I had immediate access to mentors and I made sure to leverage it. We made forward progress and I still learned a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;Leveraging the skills of the more experienced members on the team and getting near-immediate feedback makes people feel supported and keeps them productive.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;4. The Need to Offload Mental Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Our team handled sprint meetings with a daily call in the morning with the product manager, who gave us the direction of work for the day. Team members often stated, “We don’t have meetings but we can talk about anything, anytime.” However, during the ensemble, there was a balancing act between making progress and having conversations. Asking more questions meant the whole team had to stop and address the conversation. This was the same for concerns. I knew certain discussions would take a while and it would be nice to focus on getting something to prod that day instead. However, the mental load was still there — I kept thoughts in the back of my mind to find the right time to bring it up so that we would have effective conversations. These ended up taking space in my head that could otherwise be used for other focus tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On other projects I’ve been on, we would designate time for discussion topics, such as backlog grooming or retro. Retro allowed the opportunity to bring up concerns, discuss them with the team, and identify action items to address them. It was an opportunity to offload the mental task to a designated time and place. I didn’t have to talk about it now, because we would talk about it then. It also served as an opportunity for everyone’s concerns to be brought up, regardless of your working style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In this current project, a few months after joining the team, we finally held a retro which proved extremely insightful. A number of concerns were brought up and it made me realize that having a routine for these types of discussions was more valuable than expecting people to bring it up “anytime.” We decided to have retro once a month. Some teams will have retro at the end of every day for 15 minutes and others have it once a week. It is important for the team to discover what works for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;Reducing mental overhead by having designated space improves productivity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;5. The Need for Knowledge Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One interesting aspect of ensemble programming is that no one is singularly important. I know that is a strong statement and likely a huge ego blow. Let me clarify. Because everyone works on everything, siloing of information doesn’t occur. When someone left the team or went on a weeklong vacation, the team knew we would keep making progress. If I had a question, I could ask anyone else on the team for help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, certain people served as experts in certain areas because of their background and interests in certain technologies, but there was never a sense that we couldn’t work on a feature because someone was out and was the only one who knew how something worked. This was a huge benefit to the client and a huge weight off of developers’ shoulders because when they needed time off, they took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;Teams are more productive when access to useful information remains prevalent and clients benefit from not being bound to “sticky” team members.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;6. The Need for Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It was very normal for our team to try something new, stick with it if it worked and discard the idea if it didn’t. For example, we started with 20-minute driver/navigator sessions and found them to be too long. For our team, 5 minutes became the sweet spot. As another example, we initially used a kanban board to identify work tasks but it didn’t allow for ease of organization, so we switched to discovery trees. With this, we were able to identify the requirements more easily and align implementation with use cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a team, we made decisions that benefited the team without having to go through an approval process; the whole team was the approval process. When things didn’t work, we pivoted. We didn’t lose time being frustrated with a constraining process and a technology that didn’t benefit the teams’ or the client’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;Teams need to be able to make decisions that improve their productivity, protect their mental health, and secure their ability to make forward progress.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;7. The Need for Good Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ensemble really exercises a developer's communication skills. Just from a coding standpoint, I could no longer rely on my muscle memory when refactoring a component or test driving a feature. I had to explicitly explain what to do in order to control someone else’s muscles — the person typing on the keyboard. I had to explain it in a way that made sense to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;From a communication standpoint, it was important to explain why I decided what I did and how it added value. The best experience I had during the driver-navigator rotation was when the navigator, at the start of the rotation, would explain their thought process at a very high level and then went into the nitty-gritty details of what was needed to achieve the work. This gave everyone an understanding of what we were doing and allowed people to follow along more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I also found that it was important to overly communicate what was going on in my head. When I was a navigator and got stuck sometimes, people would chime in and provide help, which was great. However, if I didn’t acknowledge their suggestion explicitly and instead just kept talking to try to implement it, especially when I managed to do it incorrectly, people expressed behaviors reflecting that they felt ignored. Explicit acknowledgements such as “thanks for that suggestion, let me try a couple things to see what works” or “that's a great suggestion, what's the best way to implement that?” really hit home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Listening skills are also important. In an ensemble, I’m not listening to one other person. Often, I am listening to four other people, who may offer suggestions, ask questions, or even counter the direction I decide to go, at any given time. It is important to acknowledge what was said so that people feel heard and understood. Everyone’s voice matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;The performance and vibe of a team greatly improves with strong communication and listening skills.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ensemble programming is a software development approach where the whole team works together, builds on the principles of extreme programming, and works for distributed teams. Note that the basic fundamentals of any high-performing team is teamwork: a group of developers working together, supporting each other, and making progress toward a common goal. Ensemble programming accomplishes this through shared code ownership, knowledge sharing, and collaborative coding.&lt;/p&gt;

This release signified Cloudera’s vision of Iceberg everywhere. Customers can deploy Open Data Lakehouse wherever the data resides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;any public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud, and port workloads seamlessly across deployments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;With Cloudera Open Data Lakehouse in the private cloud, you can benefit from following key features:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-engine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; interoperability and compatibility with Apache Iceberg, including NiFi, Flink and SQL Stream Builder (SSB), Spark, and Impala.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time Travel:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Reproduce a query as of a given time or snapshot ID, which can be used for historical audits, validating ML models, and rollback of erroneous operations, as an example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table Rollback&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;: Allow users to quickly correct problems by resetting tables to a good state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rich set of SQL (query, DDL, DML) commands: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Create or manipulate database objects, run queries, load and modify data, perform time travel operations, and convert Hive external tables to Iceberg tables &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;using SQL commands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;In-place table (schema, partition) evolution: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Effortlessly evolve Iceberg table schema and partition layouts &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;without rewriting table data or migrating to a new table, for example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SDX Integration:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Provides common security and governance policies, as well as data lineage and auditing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Iceberg &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Replication: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Provides disaster recovery and table backups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easy portability of workloads&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; to public cloud and back without any code refactoring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this multi-part blog post, we’re going to show you how to use the latest Cloudera Iceberg innovation to build an Open Data Lakehouse on a private cloud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For this first part of the blog series we will focus on ingesting streaming data into the open data lakehouse and Iceberg tables making it available for further processing that we will demonstrate in the following blogs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Solution Overview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-146153 size-post-medium" height="320" src="https://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-16-at-1.48.35-PM-607x320.png" width="607" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Pre-requisites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The following components in Cloudera Open Data Lakehouse on Private Cloud should be installed and configured and airline data sets:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud/latest/release-summaries/topics/announcement-202309-719.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera Data Platform Private Cloud Base 7.1.9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cfm/2.1.6/index.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera Flow Management 2.1.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jingalls1217/airlines-source-data.git"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;https://github.com/jingalls1217/airlines-source-data.git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; (make sure to unzip the flights.csv.gzip file in the flights directory)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this example, we are going to use NiFi as part of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cfm/2.1.6/index.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;CFM 2.1.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; to stream ingest data sets to Iceberg. Please note, you can also leverage Flink and SQL Stream Builder in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/csa/latest/release-notes/topics/csa-what-new.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;CSA 1.11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; as well for streaming ingestion. We use NiFi to ingest an airport route data set (JSON) and send that data to Kafka and Iceberg. We then use Hue/Impala to take a look at the tables we created.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Please reference user documentation for installation and configuration of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud/latest/release-summaries/topics/announcement-202309-719.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera Data Platform Private Cloud Base 7.1.9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cfm/2.1.6/index.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera Flow Management 2.1.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Follow the steps below for using NiFi to stream ingest data into Iceberg tables:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;1- Create the routes Iceberg table for NiFi ingestion in Hue/Impala execute the following DDL:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-146154 size-post-medium" height="370" src="https://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-16-at-1.49.01-PM-607x370.png" width="607" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;3-Create a new process group in NiFi and upload the flow definition file downloaded in step 2. First click the Browse button, select the NiFiDemo.json file and click the Add button.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-146155 size-post-medium" height="601" src="https://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-16-at-1.49.30-PM-607x601.png" width="607" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;4- Update parameters as shown in table below:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-146156 size-post-medium" height="492" src="https://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-16-at-1.50.07-PM-607x492.png" width="607" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-146157 size-post-medium" height="466" src="https://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-16-at-1.50.22-PM-607x466.png" width="607" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;5- Click into the NiFiDemo process group: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

Amazon EC2推出了新型实例R7i，这是针对内存优化的实例，采用了定制的第四代Intel Xeon Scalable处理器，提供了在云中最高的计算性能。R7i实例适用于各种内存密集型工作负载，并具有较大的规模和高吞吐量。此外，R7i实例还配备了内置的加速器，用于加速机器学习、数据处理和分析等任务。这些实例已经在多个AWS区域上线，并提供多种购买选项。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier, we introduced a duo of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to our lineup: the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-seventh-generation-general-purpose-amazon-ec2-instances-m7i-flex-and-m7i/"&gt;general-purpose Amazon EC2 M7i instances&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c7i"&gt;compute-optimized Amazon EC2 C7i instances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m happy to share that we’re expanding these seventh-generation x86-based offerings to include memory-optimized Amazon EC2 R7i instances. These instances are powered by custom 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (Sapphire Rapids) exclusive to AWS and will offer the highest compute performance among the comparable fourth-generation Intel processors in the cloud. The R7i instances are available in eleven sizes including two bare metal sizes (coming soon), and offer 15 percent improvement in price-performance compared to Amazon EC2 R6i instances.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2 R7i instances are SAP Certified and are an ideal fit for memory-intensive workloads such as high-performance databases (SQL and NoSQL databases), distributed web scale in-memory caches (Memcached and Redis), in-memory databases (SAP HANA), real-time big data analytics (Apache Hadoop and Spark clusters) and other enterprise applications. Amazon EC2 R7i offers larger instance sizes (48xlarge) with up to 192 vCPUs and 1,536 GiB of memory, including both virtual and bare metal instances, enabling you to consolidate your workloads and scale-up applications.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can attach up to 128 EBS volumes to each R7i instance; by way of comparison, the R6i instances allow you to attach up to 28 volumes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here are the specs for the R7i instances:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table cellpadding="8" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;"&gt;

   &lt;td align="center"&gt;40 Gbps&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/tbody&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’re also getting ready to launch two sizes of bare metal R7i instances soon:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table cellpadding="8" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;"&gt; 
 &lt;tbody&gt; 
  &lt;tr style="background-color: #e0e0e0; vertical-align: bottom;"&gt;

  &lt;tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;"&gt; 
   &lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r7i.metal-24xl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td align="center"&gt;96&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td align="center"&gt;768 GiB&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td align="center"&gt;37.5 Gbps&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td align="center"&gt;30 Gbps&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;"&gt; 
   &lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r7i.metal-48xl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td align="center"&gt;192&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td align="center"&gt;1,536 GiB&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td align="center"&gt;50.0 Gbps&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td align="center"&gt;40 Gbps&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/tbody&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built-in Accelerators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Sapphire Rapids processors include four built-in accelerators, each providing hardware acceleration for a specific workload:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) &lt;/strong&gt;– The AMX extensions are designed to accelerate machine learning and other compute-intensive workloads that involve matrix operations. It improves the efficiency of these operations by providing specialized hardware instructions and registers tailored for matrix computations. Matrix operations, such as multiplication and convolution, are fundamental building blocks in various computational tasks, especially in machine learning algorithms.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA) &lt;/strong&gt;– DSA enhances data processing and analytics capabilities for a wide range of applications and enables developers to harness the full potential of their data-driven workloads. With DSA, you gain access to optimized hardware acceleration that delivers exceptional performance for data-intensive tasks.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (IAA) &lt;/strong&gt;– This accelerator runs database and analytic workloads faster, with the potential for greater power efficiency. In-memory compression, decompression, encryption at very high throughput, and a suite of analytics primitives support in-memory databases, open-source databases, and data stores like &lt;a href="https://rocksdb.org/"&gt;RocksDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clickhouse.com/"&gt;ClickHouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) &lt;/strong&gt;– This accelerator offloads encryption, decryption, and compression, freeing up processor cores and reducing power consumption. It also supports merged compression and encryption in a single data flow. To learn more start at the &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/open/quick-assist-technology/overview.html"&gt;Intel QuickAssist Technology (Intel QAT) Overview.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Advanced Matrix Extensions are available on all sizes of R7i instances. The Intel QAT, Intel IAA, and Intel DSA accelerators will be available on the r7i.metal-24xl and r7i.metal-48xl instances.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Available&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The new instances are available in the US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Spain), Europe (Stockholm), and Europe (Ireland) AWS Regions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchasing Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; R7i instances are available in On-Demand, Reserved, Savings Plan, and Spot Instance form. R7i instances are also available in Dedicated Host and Dedicated Instance form.&lt;/p&gt;

本文介绍了上周的一些重要发布内容和新功能，主要涉及Amazon EBS、AWS Systems Manager、Amazon EC2、Amazon Textract和Amazon OpenSearch Service等服务。同时还列举了其他一些值得关注的AWS新闻和博客文章，并提到了即将发生的AWS活动。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;With just 41 days until &lt;a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/"&gt;AWS re:Invent&lt;/a&gt; 2023 opens, I’m doing my best to stay heads-down and focused on working with the entire AWS News Blog team to create plenty of awesome new posts for your reading pleasure! I’ll take a short break this morning to share some of the most exciting launches and other news from last week. Here we go!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Week’s Launches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here are some of the launches that captured my attention:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon EBS&lt;/strong&gt; – The new &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-cloudwatch-metric-monitors-reachability-ebs-volumes/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attached EBS Status Check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CloudWatch metric lets you monitor the status of all of the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/"&gt;Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)&lt;/a&gt; volumes attached to a particular &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"&gt;Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)&lt;/a&gt; instance, verifying that the volumes are reachable and able to complete I/O operations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Systems Manager&lt;/strong&gt; – You can now &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/enable-aws-systems-manager-ec2-instances-organization/"&gt;enable AWS Systems Manager by default&lt;/a&gt; for all EC2 instances within an Organization. This lets you confirm that core Systems Manager capabilities are present on all new and existing instances.&lt;/p&gt;

By analyzing information about individuals, businesses can gain crucial insights to improve talent development, enhance employee experiences, and streamline human resources processes. The application of analytics to people data empowers organizations to harness the full potential of their most important asset: their people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HR/People data contains information about employees of the company and the candidate pipelines. The information is highly sensitive with fields containing attributes such as race/ethnicity, sexual orientation etc. Hence, People Insights Infrastructure is built w/ &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; as the focal point.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gusto uses &lt;code&gt;Workday&lt;/code&gt; as HRIS, Greenhouse as the choice for &lt;code&gt;ATS&lt;/code&gt; (Applicant Tracking System), &lt;code&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/code&gt; as the survey tool, &lt;code&gt;Degreed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LearnUpon&lt;/code&gt; for learning and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help with this, we have adopted &lt;a href="https://www.onemodel.co/blog/the-end-of-the-snapshot-workday-edition?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One Model&amp;apos;s People Data Cloud platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for its capabilities in extracting and modeling HR data sources. It is used specifically for its Greenhouse and Workday integration.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://deepnote.com/?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deepnote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is utilized for end-to-end data pipelines (ELTs) involving Degreed, LearnUpon, and Qualtrics. We also create denormalized tables on top of OneModels output schema, stored in a Redshift cluster hosted on OneModels AWS account. Tableau is employed as the front-end to develop insightful dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="workday-integration-employee-data"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workday Integration [Employee data]:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="application-of-employee-data"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application of employee data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce planning dashboard:&lt;/strong&gt; helps in headcount planning by utilizing the employee hiring, terminations and movement. Integration of data points -&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;employees who have accepted the offer but have a future start date - &lt;code&gt;Accepted Not Started&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Open Requisitions&lt;/code&gt; across &lt;code&gt;MoM&lt;/code&gt;aids in a single source of truth for workforce planning and forecasting.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data Feeds to Finance partners helps them run forecasts on the cost of talent($).&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Science:&amp;#xa0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study, develop and publish research on drivers of employee turnover, performance and promotion.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publish internal research around pay equity and adverse impact.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gusto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gustos-2021-RISE-Report-1.pdf?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;external&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reporting requirements of any RISE+ parameter combinations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory reporting:&amp;#xa0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DFEH: &lt;a href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/paydatareporting/?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;California Pay Data Reporting | CRD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EEO: &lt;a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/data/eeo-data-collections?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;EEO Data Collections | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="technical-architecture"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Architecture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="Data Engineering on People Data" class="kg-image" height="239" src="https://engineering.gusto.com/content/images/2023/10/OneModel_Workday_Connector.png" width="605" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Two Types of Connection between Workday and OneModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workday is built with an object-oriented approach. &lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt; objects can be queried via direct API calls and &lt;strong&gt;custom&lt;/strong&gt; objects via Reporting-as-a Service (RaaS).&amp;#xa0; &lt;code&gt;RaaS&lt;/code&gt; is a feature that exposes reports as web service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="greenhouse-integration-candidate-application-data"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenhouse Integration [Candidate &amp;amp; Application data]:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="applicationbusiness-impact"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application/Business Impact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talent lifecycle: understanding the lifecycle of a candidate applying for a role at Gusto at each stage : application &amp;#x2192; interviewing &amp;#x2192; offer &amp;#x2192; conversion to an employee in workday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean and robust recruiting data helps us inform the common &lt;a href="https://www.greenhouse.com/resources/glossary/what-are-recruitment-kpis?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;KPIs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which provides us strategic insights on sourcing, offers and overall pipeline health. Thus, able to calculate recruiting efficiency and pipeline health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="technical-architecture-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Architecture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id="greenhouse-connector-combination-of-api-calls-is-available-within-onemodel-to-extract-all-the-necessary-endpoints"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004626411-One-Model-integration?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greenhouse connector&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (combination of API calls) is available within OneModel to extract all the necessary endpoints.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For modeling the data within One Model, we are using an Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) approach where modeled tables are stored in &lt;code&gt;One&lt;/code&gt; Schema. Then we are able to build denormalized/reporting tables by writing business logic and transformation on top of One schema to build &lt;em&gt;people insights&lt;/em&gt; schema, which is the source of truth for data science, analytics reporting &amp;amp; tableau data sources.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="security-enhancements"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security enhancements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full access to the People Data Warehouse (PDW) is restricted to the People Insights team and the OneModel vendor and is IP restricted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;External reporting teams have a service account to Redshift to pull non-sensitive data from the &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; database schema. [Limited access]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PGP encryption service helps to encrypt the outbound data feeds.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For visualization and building scalable dashboards, we utilize Tableau. In Tableau, we have automated &lt;a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/scim_config_online.htm?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;managing the user permissions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by setting up user groups in workday (source system), which flows through Okta (for authentication) to reach Azure Active Directory (Identity Provider). Tableau server syncs groups every ~30 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps our team to directly leverage the groups in Tableau and immune us against the possibility of &lt;strong&gt;manual&lt;/strong&gt; errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ex: Transfer scenario: if an employee moves from People to Product, they would need to be adjusted manually within a group in tableau for the access level. This has the risk of &lt;strong&gt;unauthorized access.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These groups also serve as google groups within Gmail. This helps us be in sync with the single definition of each group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="Data Engineering on People Data" class="kg-image" height="191" src="https://engineering.gusto.com/content/images/2023/10/Indentity-Access-Management--Tableau-.png" width="634" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Identity Access Management for Tableau&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="idiosyncratic-scenarios-evergreen-requisitions-in-greenhouse"&gt;Idiosyncratic scenarios: &lt;strong&gt;Evergreen requisitions in Greenhouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each organization has &lt;a href="https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/4402883414811-Evergreen-jobs-and-HRIS-integrations?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;evergreen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; requisitions (ex: software engineering role for tech company) which runs throughout the year. However, there is no capability of connecting these roles in Greenhouse &amp;#x2190;&amp;#x2192; Workday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine, a candidate interviewing for multiple roles (at least one of them being evergreen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;reaching the offer stage for one of them in the greenhouse. At this point, we have multiple applications per candidate.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, we don&amp;#x2019;t know which one to use for calculating funnel metrics (such as &lt;code&gt;pass-through rate&lt;/code&gt;) if both applications with evergreen req are not mapped to workday. This results in skewed data points.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with OneModel, we have built an algorithm that inferences the headcount requisition which are disconnected from application with ~94% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration for following data sources are written end-to-end in &lt;a href="https://deepnote.com/?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deepnote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which provides us the ability to have a separate account for people insights team. This helps us to keep our codebase and data private.&amp;#xa0; Key feature which helps us in data pipelines is the interoperability between python and SQL in Deepnote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jobs on qualtrics drop the result of different surveys into internal SFTP, which is picked up by the data pipeline written in Deepnote to transform and write as tables within the redshift schema. This helps our team to measure the impact of any people program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LearnUpon [via &lt;a href="https://docs.learnupon.com/api/?ref=engineering.gusto.com#learnupon-technical-documentation"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x2192; data pipeline in DN]&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application:&amp;#xa0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measure any learning and development program&amp;#x2019;s effectiveness. Dashboard for managers to evaluate completion rates for courses assigned to their directs in real-time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Degreed [via FTP &amp;#x2192; data pipeline in DN]&amp;#xa0;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Degreed drops flat files into the FTP drive, which is picked up by the job running on deepnote to clean, parse and persist the data into redshift tables. We use the ELT approach for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upleveling our infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, we have built cross-account connections between three AWS accounts to ingest the data from enterprise data warehouse and write into people data warehouse. We can leverage&amp;#xa0; &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY.html?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;COPY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_UNLOAD.html?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UNLOAD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; commands to optimize the performance of writing into S3 and Redshift cluster.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gusto continues to evolve and expand, the growth of our employee, candidate, and application data is inevitable. Constant enhancements to the scalability of our systems, data pipelines, and algorithms are necessary to build efficient tools that enable self-service access to this valuable data, while ensuring that data privacy remains a top priority as well as driving informed decision-making across the organization. Our People Insights infrastructure architecture excels in security-focused batch processing and scalability for integrating new data sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

**总结：**
文章介绍了DC-SCM（数据中心安全控制模块）在服务器设计中的作用和重要性。DC-SCM的引入将基板管理控制器（BMC）和相关组件从服务器主板上解耦，并在更小的模块中进行集成。这样做的好处包括降低PCB成本、实现灵活的模块化设计以满足不同客户需求、统一的OpenBMC固件开发，以及提高服务器管理和安全硬件升级的效率。Cloudflare与Lenovo的合作项目Project Argus是其DC-SCM的具体实施，为服务器行业提供了标准化的管理、安全和控制功能。通过使用DC-SCM，Cloudflare的下一代服务器将获得更强大的管理和安全性能。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="905" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Project-Argus-DC-SCM.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, data center servers have used motherboards that included all key components on a single circuit board. The DC-SCM (Datacenter-ready Secure Control Module) decouples server management and security functions from a traditional server motherboard, enabling development of server management and security solutions independent of server architecture. It also provides opportunities for reducing server printed circuit board (PCB) material cost, and allows unified firmware images to be developed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Cloudflare is announcing that it has partnered with Lenovo to design a DC-SCM for our next-generation servers. The design specification has been published to the OCP (Open Compute Project) contribution database under the name &lt;a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/cloudfare-lenovo-project-argus-dc-scm2-0-module-design-spec-rev1-0-pdf"&gt;Project Argus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-brief-introduction-to-baseboard-management-controllers"&gt;A brief introduction to baseboard management controllers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baseboard management controller (BMC) is a specialized processor that can be found in virtually every server product. It allows remote access to the server through a network connection, and provides a rich set of server management features. Some of the commonly used BMC features include server power management, device discovery, sensor monitoring, remote firmware update, system event logging, and error reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical server design, the BMC resides on the server motherboard, along with other key components such as the processor, memory, CPLD and so on. This was the norm for generations of server products, but that has changed in recent years as motherboards are increasingly optimized for high-speed signal bandwidth, and servers need to support specialized security requirements. This has made it necessary to decouple the BMC and its related components from the server motherboard, and move them to a smaller common form factor module known as the Datacenter Secure Control Module (DC-SCM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 is a picture of a motherboard used on Cloudflare’s previous generation of edge servers. The BMC and its related circuit components are placed on the same printed circuit board as the host CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="1327" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Figure-1.png" width="1489" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: Previous Generation Server Motherboard&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Cloudflare’s next generation of edge servers, we are partnering with Lenovo to create a DC-SCM based design. On the left-hand side of Figure 2 is the printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) for the Host Processor Module (HPM). It hosts the CPU, the memory slots, and other components required for the operation and features of the server design. But the BMC and its related circuits have been relocated to a separate PCBA, which is the DC-SCM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="863" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Figure-2.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: Next Generation HPM and DC-SCM&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-dc-scm-based-server-design"&gt;Benefits of DC-SCM based server design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="pcb-cost-reduction"&gt;PCB cost reduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of today, DDR5 memory runs at 6400MT/s (mega transfers per second). In the future DDR5 speed may even increase to 7200MT/s or 8800MT/s. Meanwhile, PCIe Gen5 is running at 32 GT/s (giga transfers per second), doubling the speed rate of PCIe Gen4. Both DDR5 and PCIE Gen5 are key interfaces for the processors used on our next-generation servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing rates of high-speed IO signals and memory buses are pushing the next generation of server motherboard designs to transition from low-loss to ultra-low loss dielectric printed circuit board (PCB) materials, and higher layer counts in the PCB. At the same time, the speed of BMC and its related circuitry are not progressing so quickly. For example, the physical layer interface of ASPEED AST2600 BMC is only at PCIe Gen2 (5 GT/s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low loss dielectric PCB material and higher PCB layer count are both driving factors for higher PCB cost. Another driving factor of PCB cost is the size of the PCB. In a traditional server motherboard design, the size of the server motherboard is larger, since the BMC and its related circuits are placed on the same PCB as the host CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By decoupling the BMC and its related circuitry from the host processor module (HPM), we can reduce the size of the relatively more expensive PCB for the HPM. BMC and its related circuitry can be placed on relatively cheaper PCB, with reduced layer count and lossier PCB dielectric materials. For example, in the design of Cloudflare’s next generation of servers, the server motherboard PCB needs to be 14 or more layers, whereas the BMC and its related components can be easily routed with 8 or 10 layers of PCB. In addition, the dielectric material used on DC-SCM PCB is low-loss dielectric — another cost saver compared to ultra-low loss dielectric materials used on HPM PCB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="modularized-design-enables-flexibility"&gt;Modularized design enables flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DC-SCM modularizes server management and security components into a common add-in card form factor, enabling developers to remove customer specific solutions from the more complex components, such as motherboards, to the DC-SCM. This provides flexibility for developers to offer multiple customer-specific solutions, without the need to redesign multiple motherboards for each solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers are able to reuse the DC-SCM from a previous generation of server design, if the management and security requirements remain the same. This reduces the overall cost of upgrading to a new generation of servers, and has the potential to reduce e-waste when a server is decommissioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, management and security solution upgrades within a server generation can be carried out separately by modifying or replacing the DC-SCM. The more complex components on the HPM do not need to be redesigned. From a data center perspective, it speeds up the upgrade of management and security hardware across multiple server platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="unified-interoperable-openbmc-firmware-development"&gt;Unified interoperable OpenBMC firmware development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data center secure control interface (DC-SCI) is a standardized hardware interface between DC-SCM and the Host Processor Module (HPM). It provides a basis for electrical interoperability between different DC-SCM and host processor module (HPM) designs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interoperability makes it possible to have a unified firmware image across multiple DC-SCM designs, concentrating development resources on a single firmware rather than an array of them. The publicly-accessible &lt;a href="https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc"&gt;OpenBMC repository&lt;/a&gt; provides a perfect platform for firmware developers of different companies to collaborate and develop such unified OpenBMC images. Instead of maintaining a separate BMC firmware image for each platform, we now use a single image that can be applied across multiple server platforms. The device tree specific to each respective server is automatically loaded based on device product information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a unified OpenBMC image significantly simplifies the process of releasing BMC firmware to multiple server platforms. Firmware updates and changes are propagated to all supported platforms in a single firmware release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="project-argus"&gt;Project Argus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DC-SCM specifications have been driven by the Open Compute Project (OCP) Foundation hardware management workstream, as a way to standardize server management, security, and control features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has partnered with Lenovo on what we call Project Augus, Cloudflare’s first DC-SCM implementation that fully adheres to the &lt;a href="https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Hardware_Management/Hardware_Management_Module"&gt;DC-SCM 2.0 specification&lt;/a&gt;. In the DC-SCM 2.0 specifications, a few design items are left open for implementers to decide on the most suitable architectural choices. With the goal of improving interoperability of Cloudflare DC-SCM designs across server vendors and server designs, Project Argus includes documentation on implementation details and design decisions on form factor, mechanical locking mechanism, faceplate design, DC-SCI pin out, BMC chip, BMC pinout, Hardware Root of Trust (HWRoT), HWRoT pinout, and minimum bootable device tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="1600" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Figure-3.png" width="1139" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: Project Argus DC-SCM 2.0&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the Project Argus DC-SCM is the ASPEED AST2600 BMC System on Chip (SoC), which when loaded with a compatible OpenBMC firmware, provides a rich set of common features necessary for remote server management. ASPEED AST1060 is used on Project Argus DC-SCM as the HWRoT solution, providing secure firmware authentication, firmware recovery, and firmware update capability. Project Argus DC-SCM 2.0 uses Lattice MachXO3D CPLD with secure boot and dual boot ability as the DC-SCM CPLD to support a variety of IO interfaces including LTPI, SGPIO, UART and GPIOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanical form factor of Project Argus DC-SCM 2.0 is the horizontal External Form Factor (EFF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare and Lenovo have contributed &lt;a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/cloudfare-lenovo-project-argus-dc-scm2-0-module-design-spec-rev1-0-pdf"&gt;Project Argus Design Specification&lt;/a&gt; and reference design files to the &lt;a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/9e2b0d227655c9ea04414626aa958a72a913f315-zip"&gt;OCP contribution database&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Performance Improvements in ASP.NET Core 8</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-aspnet-core-8/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET Core 8 and .NET 8 bring many exciting performance improvements. In this blog post, we will highlight some of the enhancements made in ASP.NET Core and show you how they can boost your web app&amp;#8217;s speed and efficiency. This is a continuation of last year&amp;#8217;s post on &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-aspnet-core-7/"&gt;Performance improvements in ASP.NET Core 7&lt;/a&gt;. And, of course, it continues to be inspired by &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8"&gt;Performance Improvements in .NET 8&lt;/a&gt;. Many of those improvements either indirectly or directly improve the performance of ASP.NET Core as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="benchmarking-setup"&gt;Benchmarking Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/benchmarkdotnet"&gt;BenchmarkDotNet&lt;/a&gt; for many of the examples in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To setup a benchmarking project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new console app (&lt;code&gt;dotnet new console&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Nuget reference to BenchmarkDotnet (&lt;code&gt;dotnet add package BenchmarkDotnet&lt;/code&gt;) version 0.13.8+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change Program.cs to &lt;code&gt;var summary = BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly).Run();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the benchmarking code snippet below that you want to run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;dotnet run -c Release&lt;/code&gt; and enter the number of the benchmark you want to run when prompted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the benchmarks test internal types, and a self-contained benchmark cannot be written. In those cases we&amp;#8217;ll either reference numbers that are gotten by running the benchmarks in the repository (and link to the code in the repository), or we&amp;#8217;ll provide a simplified example to showcase what the improvement is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some cases where we will reference our end-to-end benchmarks which are public at &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/aspnet/benchmarks"&gt;https://aka.ms/aspnet/benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;. Although we only display the last few months of data so that the page will load in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="servers"&gt;Servers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 3 server implementations in ASP.NET Core; Kestrel, Http.Sys, and IIS. The latter two are only usable on Windows and share a lot of code. Server performance is extremely important because it&amp;#8217;s what processes incoming requests and forwards them to your application code. The faster we can process a request, the faster you can start running application code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kestrel"&gt;Kestrel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Header parsing is one of the first parts of processing done by a server for every request. Which means the performance is critical to allow requests to reach your application code as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kestrel we read bytes off the connection into a &lt;code&gt;System.IO.Pipelines.Pipe&lt;/code&gt; which is essentially a list of &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;s. When parsing headers we are reading from that list of &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;s and have two different code paths. One for when the full header is inside a single &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; and another for when a header is split across multiple &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/45044"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#45044&lt;/a&gt; updated the second (slower) code path to avoid allocating a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; when parsing the header, as well as optimizes our &lt;code&gt;SequenceReader&lt;/code&gt; usage to mostly use the underlying &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySequence&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which can be faster in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resulted in a ~18% performance improvement for multi-span headers as well as making it allocation free which helps reduce GC pressure. The following microbenchmark is using internal types in Kestrel and isn&amp;#8217;t easy to isolate as a minimal sample. For those interested it is located &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/8ad057426fa6a27cd648b05684afddab9d97d3d9/src/Servers/Kestrel/perf/Microbenchmarks/HttpParserBenchmark.cs#L73"&gt;with the Kestrel source code&lt;/a&gt; and was run before and after the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="width: 36.6438%;"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="width: 34.7651%;"&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 9.12752%;"&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 12.4832%;"&gt;Op/s&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 6.57718%;"&gt;Gen 0&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 9.79866%;"&gt;Allocated&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="width: 34.7651%;"&gt;MultispanUnicodeHeader &amp;#8211; Before&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 9.12752%;"&gt;573.8 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 12.4832%;"&gt;1,742,893.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 6.57718%;"&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 9.79866%;"&gt;48 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="width: 34.7651%;"&gt;MultispanUnicodeHeader &amp;#8211; After&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 9.12752%;"&gt;484.9 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 12.4832%;"&gt;2,062,450.8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 6.57718%;"&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 9.79866%;"&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an allocation profile of an end-to-end benchmark we run on our CI showing the different with this change. We reduced the &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; allocations of the scenario by 73%. From 7.8GB to 2GB (during the lifetime of the benchmark run).
&lt;img alt="shows byte[] allocations before and after change" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/10/multi-header-alloc.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/48368"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#48368&lt;/a&gt; replaced some internal custom vectorized code for ascii comparison checks with the new &lt;code&gt;Ascii&lt;/code&gt; class in .NET 8. This allowed us to remove ~400 lines of code and take advantage of improvements like AVX512 and ARM AdvSIMD that are implemented in the &lt;code&gt;Ascii&lt;/code&gt; code that we didn&amp;#8217;t have in Kestrel&amp;#8217;s implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="http-sys"&gt;Http.Sys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of 7.0 we removed some &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/43449"&gt;extra thread pool dispatching in Kestrel&lt;/a&gt; that improved performance significantly. More details are in &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-aspnet-core-7/#general-server"&gt;last years performance post&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of 8.0 we made similar changes to the Http.Sys server in &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44409"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44409&lt;/a&gt;. This improved our &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/blob/e3095f4021fef7171bb3ae86616b9156df39b7bd/src/Benchmarks/Middleware/JsonMiddleware.cs"&gt;Json end to end benchmark&lt;/a&gt; by 11% from ~469k to ~522k RPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another change we made affects large responses especially in higher latency connections. &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/47776"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#47776&lt;/a&gt; adds an on-by-default option to enable Kernel-mode response buffering. This allows application writes to be buffered in the OS layer regardless of whether the client connection has acked previous writes or not, and then the OS can optimize sending the data by parallelizing writes and/or sending larger chunks of data at a time. The benefits are clear when using connections with higher latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show a specific example we hosted a server in Sweden and a client in West Coast USA to create some latency in the connection. The following server code was used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csproj"&gt;var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.UseHttpSys(options =&amp;gt;
{
    options.UrlPrefixes.Add("http://+:12345");
    options.Authentication.Schemes = AuthenticationSchemes.None;
    options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = true;
    options.EnableKernelResponseBuffering = true; // &amp;lt;-- new setting in 8.0
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/file", () =&amp;gt;
{
    return TypedResults.File(File.Open("pathToLargeFile", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read));
});

app.Run();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latency was around 200ms (round-trip) between client and server and the server was responding to client requests with a 212MB file.
When setting &lt;code&gt;HttpSysOptions.EnableKernelResponseBuffering&lt;/code&gt; to false the file download took ~11 minutes. And when setting it to true it took ~30 seconds to download the file. That&amp;#8217;s a massive improvement, ~22x faster in this specific scenario!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on how response buffering works can be found in &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/wndp/buffering-in-http-sys"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44561"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44561&lt;/a&gt; refactors the internals of response writing in Http.Sys to remove a bunch of &lt;code&gt;GCHandle&lt;/code&gt; allocations and conveniently removes a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;GCHandle&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that was used to track handles for freeing. It does this by allocating and writing directly to &lt;code&gt;NativeMemory&lt;/code&gt; when writing headers. By not pinning managed memory we are reducing GC pressure and helping reduce heap fragmentation. A downside is that we need to be extra careful to free the memory because the allocations are no longer tracked by the GC.
Running a simple web app and tracking GCHandle usage shows that in 7.0 a small response with 4 headers was using 8 &lt;code&gt;GCHandle&lt;/code&gt;s per request, and when adding more headers it was using 2 more &lt;code&gt;GCHandle&lt;/code&gt;s per header. In 8.0 the same app was using only 4 &lt;code&gt;GCHandle&lt;/code&gt;s per request, regardless of the number of headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/45156"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#45156&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://github.com/ladeak"&gt;@ladeak&lt;/a&gt; improved the implementation of &lt;code&gt;HttpContext.Request.Headers.Keys&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HttpContext.Request.Headers.Count&lt;/code&gt; in Http.Sys, which is also the same implementation used by IIS so double win. Before, those properties had generic implementations that used &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/code&gt; and linq expressions. Now they manually count and minimize allocations, making accessing &lt;code&gt;Count&lt;/code&gt; completely allocation free.
This benchmark uses internal types, so I&amp;#8217;ll link to &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/8279d3f8ee47d5e249ef12a99e4d1cacfd5209ec/src/Servers/HttpSys/perf/Microbenchmarks/RequestHeaderBenchmarks.cs#L12"&gt;the microbenchmark source&lt;/a&gt; instead of providing a standalone microbenchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id="native-aot"&gt;Native AOT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/"&gt;Native AOT&lt;/a&gt; was first introduced in .NET 7 and only worked with console applications and a limited number of libraries.
In .NET 8.0 we&amp;#8217;ve improved the number of libraries that are supported in Native AOT as well as &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/native-aot?view=aspnetcore-8.0#aspnet-core-and-native-aot-compatibility"&gt;added support for ASP.NET Core&lt;/a&gt; applications. AOT apps can have minimized disk footprint, reduced startup times, and reduced memory demand. But before we talk about AOT more and show some numbers, we should talk about a prerequisite, trimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in .NET 6 &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained"&gt;trimming applications&lt;/a&gt; became a fully supported feature. Enabling this feature with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PublishTrimmed&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/PublishTrimmed&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt; enables the trimmer to run during publish and remove code your application isn&amp;#8217;t using. This can result in smaller deployed application sizes, useful in scenarios where you are running on memory constrained devices. Trimming isn&amp;#8217;t free though, libraries might need to annotate types and method calls to tell the trimmer about code being used that the trimmer can&amp;#8217;t determine, otherwise the trimmer might trim away code you&amp;#8217;re relying on and your app won&amp;#8217;t run as expected. The trimmer will &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/fixing-warnings"&gt;raise warnings&lt;/a&gt; when it sees code that might not be compatible with trimming. Until .NET 8 the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;TrimMode&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; property for publishing web apps was set to &lt;code&gt;partial&lt;/code&gt;. This meant that only assemblies that explicitly stated they supported trimming would be trimmed. Now in 8.0, &lt;code&gt;full&lt;/code&gt; is used for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;TrimMode&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which means all assemblies used by the app will be trimmed. These settings are documented in the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-options#trimming-granularity"&gt;trimming options docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In .NET 6 and .NET 7 a lot of libraries weren&amp;#8217;t compatible with trimming yet, notably ASP.NET Core libraries. If you tried to publish a simple ASP.NET Core app in 7.0 you would get a bunch of trimmer warnings because most of ASP.NET Core didn&amp;#8217;t support trimming yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is an ASP.NET Core app to show trimming in net7.0 vs. net8.0. All the numbers are for a windows publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-xml"&gt;&amp;lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;TargetFrameworks&amp;gt;net7.0;net8.0&amp;lt;/TargetFrameworks&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Nullable&amp;gt;enable&amp;lt;/Nullable&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ImplicitUsings&amp;gt;enable&amp;lt;/ImplicitUsings&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/Project&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;// dotnet publish --self-contained --runtime win-x64 --framework net7.0 -p:PublishTrimmed=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true --configuration Release
var app = WebApplication.Create();

app.Run((c) =&amp;gt; c.Response.WriteAsync("hello world"));

app.Run();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TFM&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Trimmed&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Warnings&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;App Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Publish duration&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net7.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;88.4MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;3.9 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;90.9MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;3.9 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net7.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;28.9MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;16.4 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;17.3MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;10.8 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to no more warnings when publishing trimmed in net8.0, the app size is smaller because we&amp;#8217;ve annotated more libraries so the linker can find more code that isn&amp;#8217;t being used by the app. Part of annotating the libraries involved analyzing what code is being kept by the trimmer and changing code to improve what can be trimmed. You can see numerous PRs to help this effort; &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47567"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#47567&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/47454"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#47454&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46082"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46082&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46015"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/45906"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#45906&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46020"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46020&lt;/a&gt;, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Publish duration&lt;/code&gt; field was calculated using the &lt;code&gt;Measure-Command&lt;/code&gt; in powershell (and deleting /bin/ and /obj/ between every run). As you can see, enabling trimming can increase the publish time because the trimmer has to analyze the whole program to see what it can remove, which isn&amp;#8217;t a free operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also introduced two smaller versions of &lt;code&gt;WebApplication&lt;/code&gt; if you want even smaller apps via &lt;code&gt;CreateSlimBuilder&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CreateEmptyBuilder&lt;/code&gt;.
Changing the previous app to use &lt;code&gt;CreateSlimBuilder&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;// dotnet publish --self-contained --runtime win-x64 --framework net8.0 -p:PublishTrimmed=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true --configuration Release
var builder = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Create();

app.Run((c) =&amp;gt; c.Response.WriteAsync("hello world"));

app.Run();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will result in an app size of 15.5MB.
And then going one step further with &lt;code&gt;CreateEmptyBuilder&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;// dotnet publish --self-contained --runtime win-x64 --framework net8.0 -p:PublishTrimmed=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true --configuration Release
var builder = WebApplication.CreateEmptyBuilder(new WebApplicationOptions()
{
    Args = args
});
var app = builder.Create();

app.Run((c) =&amp;gt; c.Response.WriteAsync("hello world"));

app.Run();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will result in an app size of 13.7MB, although in this case the app won&amp;#8217;t work because there is no server implementation registered. So if we add Kestrel via &lt;code&gt;builder.WebHost.UseKestrelCore();&lt;/code&gt; the app size becomes 15MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TFM&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Builder&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;App Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Create&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;17.3MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Slim&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;15.5MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Empty&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;13.7MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Empty+Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;15.0MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that both these APIs are available starting in 8.0 and remove a lot of defaults so it&amp;#8217;s more pay for play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#8217;ve taken a small look at trimming and seen that 8.0 has more trim compatible libraries, let&amp;#8217;s take a look at Native AOT. Just like with trimming, if your app/library isn&amp;#8217;t compatible with Native AOT you&amp;#8217;ll get warnings when building for Native AOT and there are &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net8plus%2Cwindows#limitations-of-native-aot-deployment"&gt;additional limitations&lt;/a&gt; to what works in Native AOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the same app as before, we&amp;#8217;ll enable Native AOT by adding &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PublishAot&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/PublishAot&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to our csproj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TFM&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;AOT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;App Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Publish duration&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net7.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;88.4MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;3.9 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;90.9MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;3.9 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net7.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;40MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;71.7 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;12.6MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;22.7 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like with trimming, we can test the &lt;code&gt;WebApplication&lt;/code&gt; APIs that have less defaults enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TFM&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Builder&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;App Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Create&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;12.6MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Slim&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;8.8MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Empty&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;5.7MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Empty+Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;7.8MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool! A small net8.0 app is 90.9MB and when published as Native AOT it&amp;#8217;s 12.6MB, or as low as 7.8MB (assuming we want a server, which we probably do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#8217;s take a look at some other performance characteristics of a Native AOT app; startup speed, memory usage, and RPS.
In order to properly show E2E benchmark numbers we need to use a multi-machine setup so that the server and client processes don&amp;#8217;t steal CPU from each other and we don&amp;#8217;t have random processes running like you would for a local machine. I&amp;#8217;ll be using our internal benchmarking infrastructure that makes use of the benchmarking tool &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/crank/"&gt;crank&lt;/a&gt; and our aspnet-citrine-win and aspnet-citrine-lin machines for server and load respectively. Both machine specs are described in our benchmarks &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/blob/a0577e58595b665d8e33a765991e6db71ab4ba9e/scenarios/README.md#profiles"&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, I&amp;#8217;ll be using an &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/tree/a0577e58595b665d8e33a765991e6db71ab4ba9e/src/BenchmarksApps/BasicMinimalApi"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; that uses Minimal APIs to return a json payload. This app uses the Slim builder we showed earlier as well as sets &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;InvariantGlobalization&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/InvariantGlobalization&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the csproj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we run the app without any extra settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;crank &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/scenarios/goldilocks.benchmarks.yml &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/build/ci.profile.yml &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/scenarios/steadystate.profile.yml &amp;#8211;scenario basicminimalapivanilla &amp;#8211;profile intel-win-app &amp;#8211;profile intel-lin-load &amp;#8211;application.framework net8.0 &amp;#8211;application.options.collectCounters true&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us a ~293ms startup time, 444MB working set, and ~762k RPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we run the same app but publish it as Native AOT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;crank &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/scenarios/goldilocks.benchmarks.yml &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/build/ci.profile.yml &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/scenarios/steadystate.profile.yml &amp;#8211;scenario basicminimalapipublishaot &amp;#8211;profile intel-win-app &amp;#8211;profile intel-lin-load &amp;#8211;application.framework net8.0 &amp;#8211;application.options.collectCounters true&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get ~67ms startup time, 56MB working set, and ~681k RPS.
That&amp;#8217;s ~77% faster startup speed, ~87% lower working set, and ~12% lower RPS. The startup speed is expected because the app has already been optimized, and there is no JIT running to start optimizing code. Also, in non-Native AOT apps, because startup methods are likely only called once, tiered compilation will never run on the startup methods so they won&amp;#8217;t be as optimized as they could be, but in NativeAOT the startup method will be fully optimized. The working set is a bit surprising, it is lower because Native AOT apps by default run with the new Dynamic Adaptation To Application Sizes (DATAS) GC. This GC setting tries to maintain a balance between throughput and overall memory usage, which we can see it doing with an ~87% lower working set at the cost of some RPS. You can read more about the new GC setting in &lt;a href="https://maoni0.medium.com/dynamically-adapting-to-application-sizes-2d72fcb6f1ea"&gt;Maoni0&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s also compare the Native AOT vs. non-Native AOT apps with the Server GC. So we&amp;#8217;ll add &lt;code&gt;--application.environmentVariables DOTNET_GCDynamicAdaptationMode=0&lt;/code&gt; when running the Native AOT app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we get ~64ms startup time, 403MB working set, and ~730k RPS. The startup time is still extremely fast because changing the GC doesn&amp;#8217;t affect that, our working set is closer to the non-Native AOT app but smaller due in part to not having the JIT compiler loaded and running, and our RPS is closer to the non-Native AOT app because we&amp;#8217;re using the Server GC which optimizes throughput more than memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;AOT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;GC&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Startup&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Working Set&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;RPS&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;293ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;444MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;762k&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;DATAS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;303ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;77MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;739k&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;64ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;403MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;730k&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;DATAS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;67ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;56MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;681k&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-Native AOT apps have the JIT optimizing code while it&amp;#8217;s running, and starting in .NET 8 the JIT by default will make use of dynamic PGO, this is a really cool feature that Native AOT isn&amp;#8217;t able to benefit from and is one reason non-Native AOT apps can have more throughput than Native AOT apps. You can read more about dynamic PGO in the &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#tiering-and-dynamic-pgo"&gt;.NET 8 performance blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re willing to trade some publish size for potentially more optimized code you can pass &lt;code&gt;/p:OptimizationPreference=Speed&lt;/code&gt; when building and publishing your Native AOT app. When we do this for our benchmark app (with Server GC) we get a publish size of 9.5MB instead of 8.9MB and 745k RPS instead of 730k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app we&amp;#8217;ve been using makes use of Minimal APIs which by default isn&amp;#8217;t trim friendly. It does a lot of reflection and dynamic code generation that isn&amp;#8217;t statically analyzable so the trimmer isn&amp;#8217;t able to safely trim the app. So why don&amp;#8217;t we see warnings when we Native AOT publish this app? Because we wrote a source-generator called Request Delegate Generator (RDG) that replaces your &lt;code&gt;MapGet&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MapPost&lt;/code&gt;, etc. methods with trim friendly code. This source-generator is automatically used for ASP.NET Core apps when trimming/aot publishing. Which leads us into the next section where we dive into RDG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="request-delegate-generator"&gt;Request Delegate Generator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Request Delegate Generator (RDG) is a &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview"&gt;source-generator&lt;/a&gt; created to make &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/overview"&gt;Minimal APIs&lt;/a&gt; trimmer and Native AOT friendly. Without RDG, using Minimal APIs will result in many warnings and your app likely won&amp;#8217;t work as expected. Here is a quick example to show an endpoint that will result in an exception when using Native AOT without RDG but will work with RDG enabled (or when not using Native AOT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;app.MapGet("/test", (Bindable b) =&amp;gt; "Hello world!");

public class Bindable
{
    public static ValueTask&amp;lt;Bindable?&amp;gt; BindAsync(HttpContext context, ParameterInfo parameter)
    {
        return new ValueTask&amp;lt;Bindable?&amp;gt;(new Bindable());
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This app throws when you send a &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request to &lt;code&gt;/test&lt;/code&gt; because the &lt;code&gt;Bindable.BindAsync&lt;/code&gt; method is referenced via reflection and so the trimmer can&amp;#8217;t statically figure out that the method is being used and will remove it. Minimal APIs then sees the &lt;code&gt;MapGet&lt;/code&gt; call as needing a request body which isn&amp;#8217;t allowed by default for &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; calls.
Besides fixings warnings and making the app work as expected in Native AOT, we get improved first response time and reduced publish size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without RDG, the first time a request is made to the app is when all the expression trees are generated for all endpoints in the application. Because RDG generates the source for an endpoint at compile time, there is no expression tree generation needed, the code for a specific endpoint is already available and can execute immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/tree/a0577e58595b665d8e33a765991e6db71ab4ba9e/src/BenchmarksApps/BasicMinimalApi"&gt;app used earlier&lt;/a&gt; for benchmarking AOT and look at time to first request we get ~187ms when not running as AOT and without RDG. We then get ~130ms when we enable RDG. When publishing as AOT, the time to first request is ~60ms regardless of using RDG. But this app only has 2 endpoints, so let&amp;#8217;s add 1000 more endpoints and see the difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Routes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="width: 12.8534%;"&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id="runtime-apis"&gt;Runtime APIs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section we&amp;#8217;ll be looking at changes that mainly involve updating to use new APIs introduced in .NET 8 in the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/glossary#bcl"&gt;Base Class Library (BCL)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="searchvalues"&gt;SearchValues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/45300"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#45300&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://github.com/gfoidl"&gt;@gfoidl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/47459"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#47459&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49114"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#49114&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49117"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#49117&lt;/a&gt; all make use of the new &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; type which lets these code paths take advantage of optimized search implementations for the specific values being searched for. The &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; section of the &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#searchvalues"&gt;.NET 8 performance blog&lt;/a&gt; explains more details about the different search algorithms used and why this type is so cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="spans"&gt;Spans&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46098"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46098&lt;/a&gt; makes use of the new &lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions.Split(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; source, Span&amp;lt;Range&amp;gt; destination, char separator)&lt;/code&gt; method. This allows certain cases of &lt;code&gt;string.Split(...)&lt;/code&gt; to be replaced with a non-allocating version. This saves the &lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt; allocation as well as the individual &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; allocations for the items in the &lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;. More details on this new API can be seen in the &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#spans"&gt;.NET 8 Performance post span section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="frozendictionary"&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new type introduced is &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt;. This allows constructing a dictionary optimized for read operations at the cost of slower construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49714"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#49714&lt;/a&gt; switches a &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt; in routing to use &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt;. This dictionary is used when routing an http request to the appropriate endpoint which is almost every request to an application. The following tables show the cost of creating the dictionary vs. frozen dictionary, and then the cost of using a dictionary vs. frozen dictionary respectively. You can see that constructing a &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt; can be up to 13x slower, but the overall time is still in the micro second range (1/1000th of a millisecond) and the &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt; is only constructed once for the app. What we all like to see is that the per operation performance of using &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt; is 2.5x-3.5x faster than a &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="other"&gt;Other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is a compilation of changes that enhance performance but do not fall under any of the preceding categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="regex"&gt;Regex&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the AOT effort, we noticed the regex created in &lt;code&gt;RegexRouteConstraint&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-7.0#route-constraints"&gt;route constraints&lt;/a&gt; for more info) was adding ~1MB to the published app size. This is because the route constraints are dynamic (application code defines them) and we were using the &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; constructor that accepts &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions&lt;/code&gt;. This meant the trimmer has to keep around all regex code that could potentially be used, including the &lt;code&gt;NonBacktracking&lt;/code&gt; engine which keeps ~.8MB of code. By adding &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.Compiled&lt;/code&gt; the trimmer can now see that the &lt;code&gt;NonBacktracking&lt;/code&gt; code will not be used and it can reduce the application size by ~.8MB. Additionally, using compiled regexes is faster than using the interpreted regex. The quick fix was to just add &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.Compiled&lt;/code&gt; when creating the &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; which was done in &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46192"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46192&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://github.com/eugeneogongo"&gt;@eugeneogongo&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is that this slows down app startup because we resolve constraints when starting the app and compiled regexes are slower to construct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46323"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46323&lt;/a&gt; fixes this by lazily initializing the regexes so app startup is actually faster than 7.0 when we weren&amp;#8217;t using compiled regexes. It also added caching to the route constraints which means if you share constraints in multiple routes you will save allocations by sharing constraints across routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a microbenchmark for the route builder to measure startup performance shows an almost 450% improvement when using 1000 routes due to no longer initializing the regexes.
The benchmark lives &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/8279d3f8ee47d5e249ef12a99e4d1cacfd5209ec/src/Http/Routing/perf/Microbenchmarks/Matching/CreateMatcherRegexConstraintBenchmark.cs#L29"&gt;in the dotnet/aspnetcore repo&lt;/a&gt;. It has a lot of setup code and would be a bit too long to put in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Regex improvement came from &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44770"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44770&lt;/a&gt; which switched a Regex usage in routing to use the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-source-generators"&gt;Regex Source Generator&lt;/a&gt;. This moves the cost of compiling the Regex to build time, as well as resulting in faster Regex code due to optimizations the source generator takes advantage of that the in-process Regex compiler does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll show a simplified example that demonstrates using the generated regex vs. the compiled regex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public partial class AlphaRegex
{
    static Regex Net7Constraint = new Regex(
            @"^[a-z]*$",
            RegexOptions.CultureInvariant | RegexOptions.Compiled | RegexOptions.IgnoreCase,
            TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));

    static Regex Net8Constraint = GetAlphaRouteRegex();

    [GeneratedRegex(@"^[A-Za-z]*$")]
    private static partial Regex GetAlphaRouteRegex();

    [Benchmark(Baseline = true)]
    public bool CompiledRegex()
    {
        return Net7Constraint.IsMatch("Administration") &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Net7Constraint.IsMatch("US");
    }

    [Benchmark]
    public bool SourceGenRegex()
    {
        return Net8Constraint.IsMatch("Administration") &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Net8Constraint.IsMatch("US");
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Error&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;StdDev&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CompiledRegex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;86.92 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.572 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.447 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.860 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.805 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.66&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id="analyzers"&gt;Analyzers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzers are useful for pointing out issues in code that can be hard to convey in API signatures, suggesting code patterns that are more readable, and they can also suggest more performant ways to write code. &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44799"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44799&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44791"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44791&lt;/a&gt; both from &lt;a href="https://github.com/martincostello"&gt;@martincostello&lt;/a&gt; enabled &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1854"&gt;CA1854&lt;/a&gt; which helps avoid 2 dictionary lookups when only 1 is needed, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44269"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44269&lt;/a&gt; enables a bunch of analyzers many of which help use more performant APIs and are described in more detail in last years &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance_improvements_in_net_7/#analyzers"&gt;.NET 7 Performance Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would encourage developers who are interested in performance in their own products to checkout &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/performance-warnings"&gt;performance focused analyzers&lt;/a&gt; which contains a list of many analyzers that will help avoid easy to fix performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="stringbuilder"&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; is an extremely useful class for constructing a string when you either can&amp;#8217;t precompute the size of the string to create or want an easy way to construct a string without the complications involved with using &lt;code&gt;string.Create(...)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; comes with a lot of helpful methods as well as a custom implementation of an &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/interpolated-string-handler"&gt;InterpolatedStringHandler&lt;/a&gt;. What this means is that you can &amp;#8220;create&amp;#8221; strings to add to the &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; without actually allocating the string. For example, previously you might have written &lt;code&gt;stringBuilder.Append(FormattableString.Invariant($"{key} = {value}"));&lt;/code&gt;. This would have allocated a string via &lt;code&gt;FormattableString.Invariant(...)&lt;/code&gt; then put it in the &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt;s internal &lt;code&gt;char[]&lt;/code&gt; buffer, making the string a temporary allocation. Instead you can write &lt;code&gt;stringBuilder.Append(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, $"{key} = {value}");&lt;/code&gt;. This also looks like it would allocate a string via &lt;code&gt;$"{key} = {value}"&lt;/code&gt;, but because &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; has a custom &lt;code&gt;InterpolatedStringHandler&lt;/code&gt; the string isn&amp;#8217;t actually allocated and instead is written directly to the internal &lt;code&gt;char[]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44691"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44691&lt;/a&gt; fixes some usage patterns with &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; to avoid allocations as well as makes use of the &lt;code&gt;InterpolatedStringHandler&lt;/code&gt; overload(s).
One specific example was taking a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; and converting it into a string in hexidecimal format so we could send it as a query string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;[MemoryDiagnoser]
public class AppendBenchmark
{
    private byte[] _b = new byte[30];

    [GlobalSetup]
    public void Setup()
    {
        RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(_b);
    }

    [Benchmark]
    public string AppendToString()
    {
        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        foreach (var b in _b)
        {
            sb.Append(b.ToString("x2", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture));
        }
        return sb.ToString();
    }

    [Benchmark]
    public string AppendInterpolated()
    {
        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        foreach (var b in _b)
        {
            sb.Append(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, $"{b:x2}");
        }
        return sb.ToString();
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

**总结：**
这篇文章提出了一种使用用户反馈和生成模型来提高通知邮件的用户参与度的方法。当前，通用的生成AI模型在生成内容时忽略了用户参与反馈和需求。为了解决这个问题，Nextdoor使用拒绝抽样和奖励模型来生成更有吸引力的主题行。他们的方法包括了技术细节，例如原始文本提取、奖励模型开发和成本优化。他们的实验结果显示，他们的方法可以比用户生成的主题行更有效地提高用户参与度 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generative AI (Gen AI) has demonstrated proficiency in content generation but does not consistently guarantee user engagement, mainly for two reasons. First, Gen AI generates content without considering user engagement feedback. While the content may be informative and well-written, it does not always translate to increased user engagement such as clicks. Second, Gen AI-produced content often remains generic and may not always provide the specific information that users seek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nextdoor is the neighborhood network where neighbors, businesses, and public agencies connect with each other. Nextdoor is building innovative solutions to enhance the user engagement with AI-Generated Content (AIGC). This post outlines our approach to improving user engagement through user feedback, specifically focusing on Notification email subject lines. Our solutions employ Rejection sampling [1], a technique used in reinforcement learning, to boost the engagement metrics. We believe our work presents a general framework to drive user engagement with AIGC, particularly when off-the-shelf Generative AI falls short in producing engaging content. To the best of our knowledge, this marks an early milestone in the industry’s successful use of AIGC to enhance user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Nextdoor, one of the ways to drive user growth and engagement on platform is through emails. One of the emails we have is called New and Trending &lt;a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/nextdoor-notifications-how-we-use-ml-to-keep-neighbors-informed-57d8f707aab0"&gt;notifications&lt;/a&gt;, where we send a single post that we think the user might be interested in and want to engage with. As part of sending an email, we need to determine a subject line of the email for the email audiences. Historically, we simply pick the first few words of the post being sent to be the subject line. However, in certain posts, these initial words are often greetings or introductory remarks and may not provide valuable information to the user. In the provided image example below, we observe a simple greeting, “Hello!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/707/0*1bUjaLCj0AOjUIe0" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1. New and Trending email where we show a single post. Prior to the Gen AI systems we build, we use the first words of the post as the subject line (Life and Mother Nature always find a way!)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we aim to use Generative AI technologies to improve the subject line. With Generative AI, we aim to generate informative and interesting subject lines that will lead to more email opens, clicks and eventually more sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a good subject line with Generative AI is challenging because the subject line needs to satisfy the following criteria. First and foremost, the subject line needs to be engaging so that the users want to open the email. To see if ChatGPT API can write engaging subject lines, we tried generating subject lines with ChatGPT API with a small traffic A/B test, and found that the users are less likely to click on emails if we use subject lines made by ChatGPT API (e.g. Table 1). As we show later, we tried to improve the prompts (prompt engineering) but the results were still inferior to the user-generated subjects. This finding implies that Generative AI models are not trained to write the content that is particularly engaging to our users, and we need to guide Generative AI models to increase user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/991/1*L4Uumzj8svXajgd07AUOtQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Table 1. Subject line made by ChatGPT API and its CTR. ChatGPT API’s subject line is more informative but looks like a marketing phrase, and produced only 56% clicks compared to the user-generated subject line.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second challenge is that the subject line needs to be authentic. If it reads like a marketing phrase, the email will look like spam. The example in Table 1 “Support backyard chickens in Papillion, NE!” shows this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, the subject line should not contain hallucinations (a response that is nonsensical or not accurate). And it is well known that Generative AI is vulnerable to hallucinations [2]. For example, given a very short post saying “Sun bathing ☀️”, ChatGPT API in Table 1 generated the subject line “Soak Up the Sun: Tips for Relaxing Sun Bathing Sessions”, which had nothing to do with the post content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a novel Generative AI method to overcome the three challenges faced by the ChatGPT API mentioned above. We made three contributions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt engineering to generate authentic subject lines with no hallucination:&lt;/strong&gt; Given a post, ChatGPT API creates a subject line by extracting the most interesting phrases of the post without any rewriting. By extracting the user’s original writing, we are able to prevent marketing phrases and hallucinations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejection sampling with a reward model: &lt;/strong&gt;To find the most interesting subject line, we develop a reward model whose job is to predict if the users would prefer a given subject line over other subject lines. After ChatGPT API writes a subject line, we evaluate it by the reward model and accept it only if its reward model score is higher than the user-written subject line’s score. This technique is called Rejection Sampling and recently introduced to Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model training [1].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost optimization and model accuracy maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;: We added engineering components to minimize the serving cost and stabilize the model performance. By using caching, we reduced our cost to 1/600 compared to the brute-force way. By daily performance monitoring, we can catch if reward models fail to predict which subject is more engaging due to external factors such as user preference drift and address it by retraining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that this framework is generally applicable when off-the-shelf Generative AI fails to improve user engagement. We also analyzed the importance of each component in our design. Even with the aforementioned prompt engineering, ChatGPT API did not necessarily produce more engaging content. This highlights the necessity of the rejection sampling component: in such cases, we can develop another AI model as a reward model and use the Generative AI’s output only if the reward model approves [1].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Proposed Method&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every post, we employ the following system to create a subject line. It’s important to mention that we generate a single subject line for each post, without personalization. This decision was made to minimize computational cost. Exploring cost-effective methods for implementing personalized subject lines will be an interesting future work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Model Overview&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 illustrates our approach. We develop two different AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subject line generator: This model generates a subject line given a post content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reward model (Evaluator): Given a subject line and the post content, this model predicts if the given subject line would be the better subject line than the user-generated subject line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/893/1*ejkWUk9i9BBrI74iU7g1XA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2. Overview of our approach.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a post, the Subject line generator produces subjects in Figure 2 (green boxes). The reward model compares the OpenAI API subject line (green) with the user-generated subject line (red), and selects the more engaging one. For the top post, the OpenAI API subject line contains more relevant information and is selected. For the bottom post which was about a health alert, the reward model selects the user-generated subject. While the OpenAI API subject line shows the main content of the alert, the reward model picks the user-generated subject because it shows the importance of the post and thus is more engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Developing Subject Line Generator&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use OpenAI API without fine-tuning. In the prompt, we require that OpenAI API extracts the most interesting part of the post without making any change. This way of extracting user content provides multiple benefits: First, it removes hallucinations. Second, it keeps the subject line authentic as OpenAI API does not rewrite the original content. To test the prompt engineering, we A/B tested generator outputs without reward models. We found that asking OpenAI API to extract in the prompt improves Sessions by 3% relatively compared to asking OpenAI API to rewrite the subject line from scratch (See the Results section for the details).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Developing Reward Model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fine-tune OpenAI API to develop a reward model. This is the main innovation we applied on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training data collection: &lt;/strong&gt;The challenge is to collect training data on which subject line was more engaging. Manual annotation is not possible because there are no rules deciding what subject line is more engaging. We found that the subject lines that we thought to be more engaging than the user-generated ones turned out to be less engaging (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/956/1*WgqJAkjrCROtF0SfXCz4qA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Table 2. Emails with a user-generated subject (left) generated 3x as many clicks as the emails with OpenAI API-generated subjects on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this issue, we collect training data via experimentation. For each post, we generate subject lines in two ways. One way is to use user-generated ones and the other is to use the OpenAI API generator described above. Then we serve 2–3% users (~20k) that are randomly selected with each subject line. The goal is to learn which subject line was more engaging through click data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model training:&lt;/strong&gt; We used OpenAI API to fine-tune with the labels we collected. We used ~50k examples and 40% of examples had the OpenAI API subject as the winning subject and the rest had the user subject as the winner. Given a subject line and post content, our model is fine-tuned to predict if the subject line would generate more engagement (clicks) than the user-generated subject line. The model is asked to predict if the subject line is more engaging and output “Yes” or “No”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training details:&lt;/strong&gt; We used the smallest OpenAI API model “ada” for fine-tuning. We found that larger models did not improve the predictive performance despite higher cost. We added &lt;a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5247780-using-logit-bias-to-define-token-probability"&gt;a logit bias&lt;/a&gt; of 100 for “Yes” and “No”. These biases boost the probability for the model to output “Yes” or “No”. We tried to change the number of epochs and selected the model with 4 epochs, but we did not see much difference in offline performance after 2–3 epochs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering details:&lt;/strong&gt; We added the following components for optimization and safeguarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caching: &lt;/strong&gt;For each post, we cache the outputs of our model. By processing each post only once, we reduced the cost to 1/600. In other words, each post gets sent 600 times on average and we process the post only once instead of 600 times. Caching also optimizes the OpenAI API usages (the number of tokens and the number of requests).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward model performance maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;: We monitor the reward model’s predictive performance daily, using the next day’s user clicks after the training phase as the ground truth to compare with the model’s output. Model’s predictive performance can change because our users’ preference may change and the content in Nextdoor can shift in the writing styles or topics.&lt;br /&gt;For monitoring purposes, we collect the engagement performance of different subject lines in the following way. We created a “control” user bucket where we always send emails with the user-generated subject and a “always OpenAI API” bucket where we always send with the OpenAI API subject, regardless of the reward model’s output. From these two buckets, we know the ground-truth on which subject line was more engaging, and measure the reward model’s accuracy. If the accuracy goes down by 10+%, we retrain the reward model with new data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retries with Fallback: &lt;/strong&gt;Since OpenAI API may return an error due to the rate limit or transient issues, we added retries with&lt;a href="https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt; exponential backoffs with Tenacity&lt;/a&gt;. If we fail after a certain number of retries, we fallback to the user-generated subject.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling the length of output: &lt;/strong&gt;We found that the Subject line generator would write a subject line longer than our desired length (10 words). This happened even if we specified the 10 word limit in the instruction and added examples. We post-processed the generator output by cutting the first 10 words from the generator’s output. We A/B tested different word limits and found that 10 is the optimal value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did A/B tests with different versions of the subject line generator, and with and without the reward model. For the generator, we tested the following options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing with OpenAI API: We ask OpenAI API to “write an engaging subject line for a given post”. This was the first version we tested without much prompt engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extracting with OpenAI API: We ask OpenAI API to extract the most interesting part and provide 5 examples. We also add requirements in a numbered list such as “Do not insert or remove any word.”, “Do not change capitalization”, “If the first 10 words are interesting, use them as a subject line”. We tried 4 different versions of prompts and picked the best version by A/B test metrics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the A/B test metrics, we primarily focus on Sessions. A session is an activity sequence made by the same user within a certain timeframe, and sessions quantify the number of unique user visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table 3 shows the results on Session lift compared to the “control” bucket where we use user-generated subject lines. In addition to the session metrics, our final model (last row) increased Weekly Active Users by 0.4% and Ads revenue by 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/955/1*60AFxqFwmZ39d8g2h5NQUw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Table 3. Session lift compared to the user-generated subject lines from A/B tests. The final model (last row) achieved 1% lift in sessions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is what we learned from A/B tests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prompt engineering improves the performance but has a ceiling. After a few iterations, the A/B test metrics showed only marginal improvements, failing to beat the control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding the “optimal” prompt is an elusive task, as the space of potential prompts is boundless, making it difficult to explore. Moreover, there is no established algorithmic or systematic method for enhancing prompts. Instead, the task relies on human judgment and intuition to update the prompt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reward model was the key factor in improving sessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predicting popular content is challenging, as is the reward model’s task of forecasting popular subject lines, which currently achieves about 65% accuracy. Enhancing the reward model’s performance by leveraging real-time signals like the current engagement numbers for the subject can be an interesting future work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a novel Generative AI system to increase user engagement by combining the reward model and prompt engineering. Our systems have engineering components for cost saving and monitoring. A/B tests showed that our systems can deliver more engaging subject lines than the user-generated subject lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many avenues for future work. First is to fine-tune the subject line generator. In this work, we used vanilla ChatGPT API as the generator. Instead, we can fine tune OpenAI API with the most engaging titles that the reward model identifies. For each post, we generate multiple subject lines and use the reward model to pick the winner. Then we use the winner subject to fine tune the subject line generator. This approach is called Reinforcement Learning by Rejection Sampling [1].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second is to rescore the same post daily. Currently, we pick the best subject line with a reward model once and never rescore. However, as time goes on, we may be able to see which of the OpenAI API subject line or user-generated subject line is getting more engagement, and our reward model can predict more accurately. Third is to add personalization without significantly escalating computational costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post was written by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaewonyang/"&gt;Jaewon Yang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/qi-he/"&gt;Qi He&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was led by the Generative AI team with cross-org collaboration between Notification team and ML teams.

      <title>Account takeover data, consumer insights, and emerging trends in 2023</title>
      <link>https://blog.sift.com/account-takeover-data-consumer-insights-and-emerging-trends-in-2023/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=account-takeover-data-consumer-insights-and-emerging-trends-in-2023</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Experts predict &lt;a href="https://insights.co-opfs.org/blog/3-fraud-predictions-for-2023#:~:text=According%20to%20estimates%20from%20the,series%20of%20seemingly%20innocuous%20steps."&gt;billions in fraud losses&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2023, with over $635B related to account takeover (ATO). ATOs are a type of cyberattack that result in the unauthorized access of an account, typically through the use of stolen credentials. Once an account has been compromised, it may be used to launch additional attacks, make fraudulent purchases or transactions, or steal other personal information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the Sift network, we’re seeing rising signs of automation-fueled ATO and downstream payment fraud. To understand these evolving fraud trends and get a first-hand look at the severity of these threats, Sift Trust and Safety Architects analyzed new network data and consumer insights* in our latest &lt;a href="https://resources.sift.com/ebook/q3-2023-digital-trust-safety-index-account-takeover-data-consumer-insights-and-emerging-trends/"&gt;Digital Trust &amp;amp; Safety Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Explore the following infographic and &lt;a href="https://resources.sift.com/ebook/q3-2023-digital-trust-safety-index-account-takeover-data-consumer-insights-and-emerging-trends/"&gt;read the full report&lt;/a&gt; to learn which industries were hit hardest by ATO this year, new ways fraudsters are leveraging automation to launch widespread attacks at scale, and how ATO leads to brand abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*The data highlighted in this report is derived from Sift’s global data network of one trillion (1T) events, and compares findings from Q2 2022 to Q2 2023. This report also includes insights gathered on behalf of Sift by Researchscape, which polled 1,035 U.S. adults (aged 18+) in July of 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing the Linux package archive site</title>
      <link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-linux-package-archive-site</link>
      <description>**关键词**：HashiCorp, Linux操作系统, EoL, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL

**大纲**：文章介绍了HashiCorp公司将停止支持已经到达终止生命周期（EoL）状态的Linux操作系统版本，并将这些软件包移至新的归档站点。文章列出了受影响的版本，并提供了更新现有系统以减少影响的方法。此外，文章还提到了RHEL的特殊情况，并说明了如何操作。最后，文章介绍了归档站点以及对EoL版本的常见问题解答。

**总结**：HashiCorp公司宣布将停止支持已经到达终止生命周期的Linux操作系统版本，并将这些版本的软件包移至归档站点。用户需要及时更新系统以继续获得软件包管理器的支持。对于RHEL的特殊情况，用户需要将系统更新为主要版本，并参考官方的包装指南进行配置。归档站点将提供EoL和RHEL的旧版本软件包下载，但HashiCorp将不再维护这些软件包。用户可以通过自行创建本地仓库来使用这些软件包。文章还附上了常见问题解答以解决读者的疑问。用户如有问题或关注事项，可以在HashiCorp Discuss上发帖进行讨论。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 10th, 2024, HashiCorp will no longer support versions of Linux operating systems that have reached end-of-life (EoL) status. We will move these packages to the new &lt;a href="https://archive.releases.hashicorp.com/"&gt;archive site&lt;/a&gt; where users can continue to download them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that package managers will no longer be able to download packages for these versions. To help you update existing systems to minimize impact when we stop publishing versions that have reached EoL, please see the list of impacted versions below: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora:&lt;/strong&gt; 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, and 37&lt;em&gt;, _(&lt;/em&gt;Fedora 37 will reach EoL status November 2023)_&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu:&lt;/strong&gt; Eoan, Hirsute, Impish, Groovy, and Kinetic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian:&lt;/strong&gt; Jessie and Stretch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Special case: RHEL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems will need to be updated to use the major versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) (7, 8, and 9) see our &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/official-packaging-guide"&gt;Official Packaging Guide&lt;/a&gt; for the appropriate &lt;code&gt;hashicorp.repo&lt;/code&gt; configuration. While they are not EoL versions, as part of this effort we are also removing the minor version aliases of RHEL, which include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7Server, 7Workstation, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Archival site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have migrated our EoL and RHEL minor distributions to the &lt;a href="https://archive.releases.hashicorp.com"&gt;archive site&lt;/a&gt; and users can download the packages from there instead of releases.hashicorp.com. HashiCorp will no longer be responsible for maintaining the EoL/RHEL minor packages on the archive site. Use these packages at your own risk. We highly recommend users migrate to an OS version that is currently supported by package maintainers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make these changes as clear as possible, we have created a short FAQ list below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What changes must practitioners make to continue using Linux packages from HashiCorp?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone using EoL distributions will need to upgrade their OS (and existing systems) to continue having package manager support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone currently changing their repo configs to reference RHEL minor versions will need to revert to major versions. This applies only to HashiCorp repositories, users can continue targeting minor versions for other repos if that suits them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If users want to use any EoL or RHEL minor distributions, they will need to pull from the archive site instead of the production sites (&lt;code&gt;[apt|rpm].releases.hashicorp.com&lt;/code&gt;). However, we highly encourage users to migrate and use current versions. HashiCorp will not offer official support or publish any updates to fix issues with EoL packages on the archive site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: If a user is running on supported versions of HashiCorp products but on an EoL OS, what is the workaround?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Users can install via .zip instead of Linux packages or download the packages manually from &lt;a href="https://archive.releases.hashicorp.com/"&gt;https://archive.releases.hashicorp.com/&lt;/a&gt; and create their own local repo (users can generate their own metadata, allowing their hosts to then use the local repo via package managers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Will moving EoL versions to the archive site become a regular thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. This process will become a regular occurance when a distribution version reaches end-of-life status. We will follow the EoL cycles that distribution maintainers have set up for their distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have concerns or questions, please create a post on &lt;a href="https://discuss.hashicorp.com/"&gt;HashiCorp Discuss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Complete Guide on How to Conduct an Effective Customer and Segmentation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/how-to-write-customer-analysis/</link>
      <description>&lt;img alt="Complete Guide on How to Conduct an Effective Customer and Segmentation Analysis" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/istock-503712960-1-.jpg" style="float: right;" title="Complete Guide on How to Conduct an Effective Customer and Segmentation Analysis" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of undertaking customer analysis as part of a business plan is to examine the consumers most likely to purchase your product or service in-depth. Brands can establish different groups of customers and the needs of those customers. By understanding what motivates them to make a purchase, brands can build their business around providing solutions to those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer analysis should move through three different stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You first need to identify who your current customers are. The more detailed understanding you have of your customers the better. This one group of customers should then be split into sub-groups that have similar traits and motivations. You can also identify target customers you are not yet reaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer analysis must then show what the needs of these different customer groups are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You then need to work out what bridges these two, identifying how the company&amp;#8217;s products meet the needs of each customer group. How do you provide solutions to their pain points?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;[bw_also_like id=&amp;#8221;84283&amp;#8243;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who are your customers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about your customers in a variety of ways, and a mix of research methods will give you the most accurate results. It is best to gather as much information as possible, and to not fall into thinking details are irrelevant. Details like age, gender, location, demographics and psychographics are all important, but so are their interests, other brands they like, publications they read and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to them and running a survey will be the best way of hearing about them in their own words, although that does come with biases. Reduce this by complementing that research with sales data, CRM data, and speaking to customer-facing employees. Once you have identified these groups, social data can elaborate your understanding by providing a more holistic view of the groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="customer analysis involves identifying who your customer actually are" class="aligncenter wp-image-87268" height="568" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock-183384139-1024x727.jpg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also worth considering at this stage if the buyer and user are the same person. In a B2B setting, the buyer might hold budget responsibility but not actually use the service/software/product. In a B2C setting, there are several situations when a buyer might not be the user; a toy water pistol or a diamond ring are unlikely to be used by the purchaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Segment these groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot undertake an accurate customer analysis without segmenting your audience into groups whose members are homogenous while being distinct from other groups. Your segmentation criteria should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; Your analysis should identify the size of a market segment so that you can decide to what extent efforts should be focused on the segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinguishable:&lt;/strong&gt; Observable differences that are clearly defined must exist in order to characterize segments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substantial:&lt;/strong&gt; The market needs to be large enough to justify segmenting, with each segment substantial enough to make it worthwhile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial:&lt;/strong&gt; There will be additional costs when marketing to multiple, separate groups, so the predicted income must exceed these costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible:&lt;/strong&gt; Your marketing messages should be accessible to each market segment. Different groups will respond better to different forms of advertising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="segment your customers like they're sweets" class="aligncenter wp-image-87270" height="600" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock-172641079-1024x768.jpg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Develop customer profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your data, your segmentation criteria, some educated guesswork, and &lt;a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/buyer-personas-wrong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;develop some buyer personas&lt;/a&gt;. It helps to have personas so you can visualize a human rather than aiming for an abstract idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements to include in a buyer persona include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background and responsibilities:&lt;/b&gt; including job title, career path, and their primary job responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demographics:&lt;/b&gt; gender, age, income, family, and location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communication:&lt;/b&gt; which channels do they prefer? What is their demeanor? Do they have an assistant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Media and influencers:&lt;/b&gt; which publications do they follow, and which individuals are leading the conversation in their world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenges vs proposition:&lt;/b&gt; The challenges they face in implementing their primary job goals and how your product or service can help them overcome those issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objections:&lt;/b&gt; common reasons why this persona wouldn’t choose your product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Common language:&lt;/b&gt; what language should you use to appeal to their needs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quotes:&lt;/b&gt; adding some qualitative data in the form of quotes can really help to bring the personas to life and remind you there are real people behind these aggregated models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discover their needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in customer analysis is to get a good idea of what the customer&amp;#8217;s needs are. By understanding their needs, several departments can gear their output towards answering these questions, rather than taking an &amp;#8220;If you build it, they will come&amp;#8221; approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="maze" class="aligncenter wp-image-87271" height="533" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock-123496282-1024x683.jpg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways to do discover what your customers&amp;#8217; pain points are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way is to ask them. A survey is great if you can get enough responses and online services like &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SurveyMonkey&lt;/a&gt; can keep the cost down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the past actions of the group, such as the percentage that have purchased a similar product at some time in the past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at questions asked on &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For B2B businesses, looking at job adverts for your target customers can give you an insight into their day to day work and problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join LinkedIn professional groups to get an insight into questions and discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social intelligence can again help to understand the issues faced by customers. You can begin by building an audience of your personas, and then monitor that group for questions asked, relevant content shared (such as How To guides), and discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does your brand meet the needs of the customer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve done your research and outlined your different customer groups and their needs, you should connect the dots to your brand and identify how you meet those needs. This section of customer analysis should just be a matter of discussing and brainstorming with internal partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="key in door" class="aligncenter wp-image-87272" height="533" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock-519362709-1024x683.jpg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution based answers should come out of this process. Rather than saying, &amp;#8220;we have these features&amp;#8221;, you should be focusing on how those features deliver solutions to the problems faced by your customers and prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving the problems that customers face on a daily basis will resonate with them much better than shouting about a shiny new feature. Focus on how you can make their lives easier and more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will obviously be reflected in marketing, but these insights can help sales and &lt;a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/new-product-development-research/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;product development&lt;/a&gt; as well, tightening your focus to better match your customer&amp;#8217;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CodeSOD: Not My Domain</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/not-my-domain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dian&lt;/strong&gt; found this code snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-java"&gt;String[] key_value = url.split(&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"\\."&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i=key_value.length; i&amp;gt;&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i--) {
        &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (i &amp;gt; &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
                domain = key_value[i-&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;]+&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"."&lt;/span&gt;+key_value[i-&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;];
        &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm still not sure what this is supposed to do," Dian writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is someone's attempt to extract the TLD and primary domain from a URL, e.g. &lt;code&gt;www.mysite.com&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;mysite.com&lt;/code&gt;. (Remember when &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;s were on every domain name?) Why they chose to use a loop that only executes once, I'll never understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: Also, so many ways this code could fail --&gt;&lt;div&gt;

      <title>More ways for users to identify independently security tested apps on Google Play</title>
      <link>http://security.googleblog.com/2023/11/more-ways-for-users-to-identify.html</link>
      <description>&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Nataliya Stanetsky, Android Security and Privacy Team&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Keeping Google Play safe for users and developers remains a top priority for Google. As users increasingly prioritize their digital privacy and security, we continue to invest in our &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/data-safety/"&gt;Data Safety section&lt;/a&gt; and transparency labeling efforts to help users make more informed choices about the apps they use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://iotsecurityprivacy.org/research"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that transparent security labeling plays a crucial role in consumer risk perception, building trust, and influencing product purchasing decisions. We believe the same principles apply for labeling and badging in the Google Play store. The transparency of an app’s data security and privacy play a key role in a user’s decision to download, trust, and use an app.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Highlighting Independently Security Tested VPN Apps&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last year, App Defense Alliance (ADA) &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/app-defense-alliance-expansion.html"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; MASA (Mobile App Security Assessment), which allows developers to have their apps independently validated against a &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-app-security/"&gt;global&lt;/a&gt; security standard. This signals to users that an independent third-party has validated that the developers designed their apps to meet these industry mobile security and privacy minimum best practices and the developers are going the extra mile to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. This, in turn, makes it harder for attackers to reach users' devices and improves app quality across the ecosystem. Upon completion of the successful validation, Google Play gives developers the option to declare an “Independent security review” badge in its Data Safety section, as shown in the image below. While certification to baseline security standards does not imply that a product is free of vulnerabilities, the badge associated with these validated apps helps users see at-a-glance that a developer has prioritized security and privacy practices and committed to user safety.  
&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-bur36840wvlCyW9uYY9bV_at1TiM3Va9mBaxxXPEYXHz4Ckoc1p_mLq9OWJ0aLZbB24ePm8CiTcrfI76ozLTkF7slHAhtk3U7oT8sKxnjM-DOUubll2T_a9p9hyPBNZtRpH9cH3hfqVRdTxMtHzMsgAEsP2uK0AajKoANMdRjZ5WphFV3c3H8dNC5G8i/s1600/independent-review-wrapped.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-bur36840wvlCyW9uYY9bV_at1TiM3Va9mBaxxXPEYXHz4Ckoc1p_mLq9OWJ0aLZbB24ePm8CiTcrfI76ozLTkF7slHAhtk3U7oT8sKxnjM-DOUubll2T_a9p9hyPBNZtRpH9cH3hfqVRdTxMtHzMsgAEsP2uK0AajKoANMdRjZ5WphFV3c3H8dNC5G8i/s1600/independent-review-wrapped.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;
To help give users a simplified view of which apps have undergone an &lt;a href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/masa"&gt;independent security validation&lt;/a&gt;, we’re introducing a new Google Play store banner for specific app types, starting with VPN apps. We’ve launched this banner beginning with VPN apps due to the sensitive and significant amount of user data these apps handle. When a user searches for VPN apps, they will now see a banner at the top of Google Play that educates them about the “Independent security review” badge in the Data Safety Section. Users also have the ability to “Learn More”, which redirects them to the &lt;a href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/directory?category=vpn"&gt;App Validation Directory&lt;/a&gt;, a centralized place to view all VPN apps that have been independently security reviewed. Users can also discover additional technical assessment details in the App Validation Directory, helping them to make more informed decisions about what VPN apps to download, use, and trust with their data. 

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgz8TSWR5-nrJ70yg1TBGGf8oUKlZSGkZ0yOWs3U8EcIsThHh1qGXOXK-L9AaRaY9p6ikw01BByQScARRFNZ2jlFUnYbBvoX8b8wOSoqWlBQpckNMkQC3pRL4X-LiYb21V9gyW24Fyc6YEeKLqRd3m3xwbAS3qETWuTk5yUziuU8-yH1W5RF3eN_vuQFrc0/s976/play-store-vpn-wrapped.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="600" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgz8TSWR5-nrJ70yg1TBGGf8oUKlZSGkZ0yOWs3U8EcIsThHh1qGXOXK-L9AaRaY9p6ikw01BByQScARRFNZ2jlFUnYbBvoX8b8wOSoqWlBQpckNMkQC3pRL4X-LiYb21V9gyW24Fyc6YEeKLqRd3m3xwbAS3qETWuTk5yUziuU8-yH1W5RF3eN_vuQFrc0/s600/play-store-vpn-wrapped.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

VPN providers such as NordVPN, Google One, ExpressVPN, and others have already undergone independent security testing and publicly declared the badge showing their good standing with the MASA program. We encourage and anticipate additional VPN app developers to undergo independent security testing, bringing even more transparency to users. If you are a VPN developer and interested in learning more about this feature, please &lt;a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/mindependentsecurityreview/"&gt;submit this form&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Our Commitment to App Security and Privacy Transparency on Google Play&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By encouraging independent security testing and displaying security badges for validated apps, we highlight developers who prioritize user safety and data transparency.  We also provide developers with app security and privacy best practices – through &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=iuIe1B2CKCxFBhCY&amp;amp;v=FuYjzf8lymw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;Play PolicyBytes videos&lt;/a&gt;, webinars, &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/?sjid=12212977848216103339-NA"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/community?hl=en"&gt;Developer Help Community&lt;/a&gt;, and other resources – in accordance with our developer policies that help keep Google Play safe. We are continually working on improvements to our app review process, policies, and programs to keep users safe and to help developers navigate our policies with ease. To learn more about how we give developers the tools to succeed while keeping users safe on Google Play, read the &lt;a href="https://safety.google/intl/en_us/stories/google-play-safety/"&gt;Google Safety Center&lt;/a&gt; article.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our efforts to prioritize security and privacy transparency on Google Play are aligned with the needs and expectations we’ve heard from both users and developers. We believe that by prioritizing initiatives that bolster user safety and trust, we can foster a thriving app ecosystem where users can make more informed app decisions and developers are encouraged to uphold the highest standards of security and privacy.

      <title>Zero-shot adaptive prompting of large language models</title>
      <link>http://blog.research.google/2023/11/zero-shot-adaptive-prompting-of-large.html</link>
      <description>&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Xingchen Wan, Student Researcher, and Ruoxi Sun, Research Scientist, Cloud AI Team&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqTosaeIs4AMYukkmgUBEii6iQcrr9_dNKM0cHnW6m9Wi8yX0V-QCduQfkqLyQPNpVbze3OFO-nPG5Wm9DLMM8pEAfhQGq-TEJroLJGQyqNr-hlJNkToBCmgJbphrCRvlv95gkDQH0ScT7VrXu2VCTKyiWy8yYM4G8voF0kD0K2oxwg2M2xBcz1yQnU0Zb/s600/USP.gif" style="display: none;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) are very promising as reflected in their capability for general problem-solving in &lt;em&gt;few-shot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;zero-shot&lt;/em&gt; setups, even without explicit training on these tasks. This is impressive because in the few-shot setup, LLMs are presented with only a few question-answer demonstrations prior to being given a test question. Even more challenging is the zero-shot setup, where the LLM is directly prompted with the &lt;em&gt;test question only&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even though the few-shot setup has dramatically reduced the amount of data required to adapt a model for a specific use-case, there are still cases where generating sample prompts can be challenging. For example, handcrafting even a small number of demos for the broad range of tasks covered by general-purpose models can be difficult or, for unseen tasks, impossible. For example, for tasks like summarization of long articles or those that require domain knowledge (e.g., medical question answering), it can be challenging to generate sample answers. In such situations, models with high zero-shot performance are useful since no manual prompt generation is required. However, zero-shot performance is typically weaker as the LLM is not presented with guidance and thus is prone to spurious output. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In “&lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.216/"&gt;Better Zero-shot Reasoning with Self-Adaptive Prompting&lt;/a&gt;”, published at &lt;a href="https://2023.aclweb.org/"&gt;ACL 2023&lt;/a&gt;, we propose &lt;em&gt;Consistency-Based Self-Adaptive Prompting (COSP) &lt;/em&gt;to address this dilemma. COSP is a zero-shot automatic prompting method for reasoning problems that carefully selects and constructs &lt;em&gt;pseudo-&lt;/em&gt;demonstrations for LLMs using only unlabeled samples (that are typically easy to obtain) and the models’ own predictions. With COSP, we largely close the performance gap between zero-shot and few-shot while retaining the desirable generality of zero-shot prompting. We follow this with “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14926"&gt;Universal Self-Adaptive Prompting&lt;/a&gt;“ (USP), accepted at &lt;a href="https://2023.emnlp.org/"&gt;EMNLP 2023&lt;/a&gt;, in which we extend the idea to a wide range of &lt;em&gt;general &lt;/em&gt;natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Prompting LLMs with their own outputs&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Knowing that LLMs benefit from demonstrations and have at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; zero-shot abilities, we wondered whether the model’s zero-shot outputs could serve as demonstrations for the model to prompt itself. The challenge is that zero-shot solutions are imperfect, and we risk giving LLMs poor quality demonstrations, which could be worse than no demonstrations at all. Indeed, the figure below shows that adding a correct demonstration to a question can lead to a correct solution of the test question (Demo1 with question), whereas adding an incorrect demonstration (Demo 2 + questions, Demo 3 with questions) leads to incorrect answers.  Therefore, we need to select reliable self-generated demonstrations.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5QShw0e9OdtzA9Ob5vAtWloPZGIZgCGFSL9okO-5pxIN3M2QciE1MOT73NsdaHwOz5LiH94IZRkE0SYSJ2fiiBSNR_qHCrO-URHqZPq7Fhhpvm6wtykLsySfF9l5ERsbOqtT_J1-A8pjoOa9htdvXEnL4-WRbP-Kn85aIz7G-BvWNflcaG4lUPomVlLU8/s1051/image6.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5QShw0e9OdtzA9Ob5vAtWloPZGIZgCGFSL9okO-5pxIN3M2QciE1MOT73NsdaHwOz5LiH94IZRkE0SYSJ2fiiBSNR_qHCrO-URHqZPq7Fhhpvm6wtykLsySfF9l5ERsbOqtT_J1-A8pjoOa9htdvXEnL4-WRbP-Kn85aIz7G-BvWNflcaG4lUPomVlLU8/w472-h640/image6.png" width="472" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;Example inputs &amp;amp; outputs for reasoning tasks, which illustrates the need for carefully designed selection procedure for in-context demonstrations (&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01413"&gt;MultiArith&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;dataset &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311"&gt;PaLM-62B&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;model): (1) zero-shot&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html" style="text-align: left;"&gt;chain-of-thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;with no demo: correct logic but wrong answer; (2) correct demo (Demo1) and correct answer; (3) correct but repetitive demo (Demo2) leads to repetitive outputs; (4) erroneous demo (Demo3) leads to a wrong answer; but (5) combining Demo3 and Demo1 again leads to a correct answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
COSP leverages a key observation of LLMs: that confident and consistent predictions are more likely correct. This observation, of course, depends on how good the uncertainty estimate of the LLM is. Luckily, in large models, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05221"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11610"&gt;works&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the uncertainty estimates are robust. Since measuring confidence requires only model predictions, not labels, we propose to use this as a zero-shot proxy of correctness. The high-confidence outputs and their inputs are then used as &lt;em&gt;pseudo&lt;/em&gt;-demonstrations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this as our starting premise, we estimate the model’s confidence in its output based on its &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171"&gt;self-consistency&lt;/a&gt; and use this measure to select robust self-generated demonstrations. We ask LLMs the same question multiple times with zero-shot &lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html"&gt;chain-of-thought&lt;/a&gt; (CoT) prompting. To guide the model to generate a range of possible rationales and final answers, we include randomness controlled by a “temperature” hyperparameter. In an extreme case, if the model is 100% certain, it should output identical final answers each time. We then compute the entropy of the answers to gauge the uncertainty — the answers that have high self-consistency and for which the LLM is more certain, are likely to be correct and will be selected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assuming that w&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; are presented with a collection of unlabeled questions, the COSP method is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input each unlabeled question into an LLM, obtaining multiple rationales and answers by sampling the model multiple times. The most frequent answers are highlighted, followed by a score that measures consistency of answers across multiple sampled outputs (higher is better). In addition to favoring more consistent answers, we also penalize repetition within a response (i.e., with repeated words or phrases) and encourage diversity of selected demonstrations. We encode the preference towards consistent, un-repetitive and diverse outputs in the form of a scoring function that consists of a weighted sum of the three scores for selection of the self-generated pseudo-demonstrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We concatenate the pseudo-demonstrations into test questions, feed them to the LLM, and obtain a final predicted answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidn_WHASrzLG7rsqvKr5XqTi0VE0hEonQJsCRy0XHnM_DsWP4u1izMPUvfakpLd9FJvu47XXspD3vgIXrnrEhbrGR5vxSkcRRtbrU7HwHh6zLpywepMg39GUAW6uSVYxW-JzdOl5IVt9KPqLDVVCvjz86e6vQgZK79FKAF5wGdpztohbWhe7tVtVwcNBgh/s949/image4.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidn_WHASrzLG7rsqvKr5XqTi0VE0hEonQJsCRy0XHnM_DsWP4u1izMPUvfakpLd9FJvu47XXspD3vgIXrnrEhbrGR5vxSkcRRtbrU7HwHh6zLpywepMg39GUAW6uSVYxW-JzdOl5IVt9KPqLDVVCvjz86e6vQgZK79FKAF5wGdpztohbWhe7tVtVwcNBgh/s16000/image4.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;Illustration of COSP: In Stage 1 (&lt;strong&gt;left&lt;/strong&gt;), we run zero-shot CoT multiple times to generate a pool of demonstrations (each consisting of the question, generated rationale and prediction) and assign a score. In Stage 2 (&lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;), we augment the current test question with pseudo-demos (blue boxes) and query the LLM again. A majority vote over outputs from both stages forms the final prediction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
COSP focuses on question-answering tasks with CoT prompting for which it is easy to measure self-consistency since the questions have unique correct answers. But this can be difficult for other tasks, such as open-ended question-answering or generative tasks that don’t have unique answers (e.g., text summarization). To address this limitation, we introduce USP in which we generalize our approach to other general NLP tasks:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Classification&lt;/em&gt; (CLS): Problems where we can compute the probability of each class using the neural network output logits of each class. In this way, we can measure the uncertainty without multiple sampling by computing the entropy of the logit distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short-form generation&lt;/em&gt; (SFG): Problems like question answering where we can use the same procedure mentioned above for COSP, but, if necessary, without the rationale-generating step.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-form generation&lt;/em&gt; (LFG):&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Problems like summarization and translation, where the questions are often open-ended and the outputs are unlikely to be identical, even if the LLM is certain. In this case, we use an &lt;em&gt;overlap metric&lt;/em&gt; in which we compute the average of the &lt;em&gt;pairwise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)"&gt;ROUGE score&lt;/a&gt; between the different outputs to the same query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Similar to COSP, the LLM first generates predictions on an unlabeled dataset whose outputs are scored with logit entropy, consistency or alignment, depending on the task type, and pseudo-demonstrations are selected from these input-output pairs. In Stage 2, the test instances are augmented with pseudo-demos for prediction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
We compute the relevant confidence scores depending on the type of task on the aforementioned set of unlabeled test samples. After scoring, similar to COSP, we pick the confident, diverse and less repetitive answers to form a model-generated pseudo-demonstration set. We finally query the LLM again in a few-shot format with these pseudo-demonstrations to obtain the final predictions on the entire test set.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;h2&gt;Key Results&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
For COSP, we focus on a set of six arithmetic and commonsense reasoning problems, and we compare against 0-shot-CoT (i.e., “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916"&gt;Let’s think step by step&lt;/a&gt;“ only). We use self-consistency in all baselines so that they use roughly the same amount of computational resources as COSP. Compared across three LLMs, we see that zero-shot COSP significantly outperforms the standard zero-shot baseline.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
For USP, we expand our analysis to a much wider range of tasks, including more than 25 classifications, short-form generation, and long-form generation tasks. Using the state-of-the-art PaLM 2 models, we also test against the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261"&gt;BIG-Bench Hard&lt;/a&gt; suite of tasks where LLMs have previously underperformed compared to people. We show that in all cases, USP again outperforms the baselines and is competitive to prompting with golden examples. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsJh9EIxiF8m6jqOM7vYniG6LX8gFVa0W3V7_DEOwMCEZjbk_M4104Tg-3qMUAbYXaR3RqMTQsrZ8TN3Np5I9SXHBVJGjB6E6_1khoubPbbR-AjUnV37TYGBHu2DJpR50Ek34dwcFkjJB-OTqW4T4E-zjQhJqPX-f_PxSj7322nU2qH2VK0TBMO1QKUkfT/s901/image5.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsJh9EIxiF8m6jqOM7vYniG6LX8gFVa0W3V7_DEOwMCEZjbk_M4104Tg-3qMUAbYXaR3RqMTQsrZ8TN3Np5I9SXHBVJGjB6E6_1khoubPbbR-AjUnV37TYGBHu2DJpR50Ek34dwcFkjJB-OTqW4T4E-zjQhJqPX-f_PxSj7322nU2qH2VK0TBMO1QKUkfT/w592-h640/image5.png" width="592" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;Accuracy on BIG-Bench Hard tasks with PaLM 2-M (each line represents a task of the suite). The gain/loss of USP (green stars) over standard 0-shot (green triangles) is shown in percentages. “Human” refers to average human performance; “AutoCoT” and “Random demo” are baselines we compared against in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14926"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;; and “3-shot” is the few-shot performance for three handcrafted demos in CoT format.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
We also analyze the working mechanism of USP by validating the key observation above on the relation between confidence and correctness, and we found that in an overwhelming majority of the cases, USP picks confident predictions that are more likely better in all task types considered, as shown in the figure below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjahSci_hJqgqxS-my79ZlINe9Dpi0yaLrMTXeTu-HXjmmAmhVXtylXK7BUdJGIPMFhFvqv31Wd6ux2ti1hJLIi9Rr8j_PIjD9ElUTWx0ViaP1fLg63Q9lqvgd7U74Uqi45IOU3CsqHaqjO94iSLyPD2dZCJf5x5hsHfU_6yukbJHpG6wDzdSVp7nwBHNFx/s1474/image2.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjahSci_hJqgqxS-my79ZlINe9Dpi0yaLrMTXeTu-HXjmmAmhVXtylXK7BUdJGIPMFhFvqv31Wd6ux2ti1hJLIi9Rr8j_PIjD9ElUTWx0ViaP1fLg63Q9lqvgd7U74Uqi45IOU3CsqHaqjO94iSLyPD2dZCJf5x5hsHfU_6yukbJHpG6wDzdSVp7nwBHNFx/s16000/image2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;USP picks confident predictions that are more likely better. Ground-truth performance metrics against USP confidence scores in selected tasks in various task types (blue: CLS, orange: SFG, green: LFG) with PaLM-540B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Zero-shot inference is a highly sought-after capability of modern LLMs, yet the success in which poses unique challenges. We propose COSP and USP, a family of versatile, zero-shot automatic prompting techniques applicable to a wide range of tasks. We show large improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines over numerous task and model combinations.
&lt;/p&gt;

"I guess my pizza will be here next time I write a date bug?"

&lt;p&gt;Consumer 
&lt;strong&gt;Gordon S.&lt;/strong&gt; reports 
"I was trying to clear up my subscription ending an issue
early (but that's a WTF for another day) and can't get
seem to get through to their chat. Looks like they got
impatient waiting for their support to connect too. The
message field is disabled, not that there's anyone listening."
If you look closely you'll see that they
also managed to perform MY personal pet peeve: blithe use of the wrong timezone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheDailyWtf#cr"&gt;&lt;img alt="cr" border="0" src="https://thedailywtf.com/images/23/q1/143/02-cr.png" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosopher 
&lt;strong&gt;Daniel
&lt;/strong&gt; hypothesizes the reasoning behind this Tautological Error Message.
"Why can't you delete this disk? Because it's
attached to a VM! Which VM, you ask? That's top secret.
I can neither confirm nor deny its existence."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheDailyWtf#vm"&gt;&lt;img alt="vm" border="0" src="https://thedailywtf.com/images/23/q1/143/03-vm.png" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebooker
&lt;strong&gt;Craig

"I love a delicious glass of {{product.brand}}"

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a fail-merge from 
&lt;strong&gt;Manuel
&lt;/strong&gt; which undoubtedly went unnoticed because almost nobody
actually pays attention to the archaic multipart/alternative anymore (except Manuel!).
"I got this e-mail (upper one) today from my internet
provider, where they asked me for feedback. I wasn't sure
whether they wanted feedback for their language skills,
since the subject is Estonian and the body is English,
or for their ability to send automated mails. Even more
surprising, when I switched to view the message body as
HTML instead of text (my default), it was suddenly
Estonian, and also the content was different."

      <title>Best of both worlds: Achieving scalability and quality in text clustering</title>

      <description>&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Sara Ahmadian and Mehran Kazemi, Research Scientists, Google Research&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjR2mD5afdT_Qg9Ex4Lj94FaxB9KHiq20iLoDlOY8S8Rk5XsV6n_4dU9CFbCvSeBSONGQYqy-yMGY6-KU_y_RGICOpz76GNdzv7ecxor_rVnF31lZOd3STQF4MIE4F_EadrSI1DXY67MXnsCswY3w3X8vX8KgU_rRPs6eTZndYAbVcEezgwaUsdZEAHD59Z/s320/hero.jpg" style="display: none;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"&gt;Clustering&lt;/a&gt; is a fundamental, ubiquitous problem in data mining and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning"&gt;unsupervised&lt;/a&gt; machine learning, where the goal is to group together similar items. The standard forms of clustering are metric clustering and graph clustering. In metric clustering, a given metric space defines distances between data points, which are grouped together based on their &lt;em&gt;separation&lt;/em&gt;. In graph clustering, a given graph connects similar data points through edges, and the clustering process groups data points together based on the &lt;em&gt;connections&lt;/em&gt; between them. Both clustering forms are particularly useful for large corpora where class labels can’t be defined. Examples of such corpora are the ever-growing digital text collections of various internet platforms, with applications including organizing and searching documents, identifying patterns in text, and recommending relevant documents to users (see more examples in the following posts: &lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2010/10/clustering-related-queries-based-on.html?m=1"&gt;clustering related queries based on user intent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2021/10/practical-differentially-private.html"&gt;practical differentially private clustering&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The choice of text clustering method often presents a dilemma. One approach is to use embedding models, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)"&gt;BERT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692"&gt;RoBERTa&lt;/a&gt;, to define a metric clustering problem. Another is to utilize &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@geetkal67/attention-networks-a-simple-way-to-understand-cross-attention-3b396266d82e"&gt;cross-attention&lt;/a&gt; (CA) models, such as &lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html"&gt;PaLM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer"&gt;GPT&lt;/a&gt;, to define a graph clustering problem. CA models can provide highly accurate similarity scores, but constructing the input graph may require a prohibitive quadratic number of inference calls to the model. On the other hand, a metric space can efficiently be defined by distances of embeddings produced by embedding models. However, these similarity distances are typically of substantial lower-quality compared to the similarity signals of CA models, and hence the produced clustering can be of much lower-quality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Motivated by this, in “&lt;a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=p0JSSa1AuV"&gt;KwikBucks: Correlation Clustering with Cheap-Weak and Expensive-Strong Signals”, presented at ICLR 2023&lt;/a&gt;, we describe a novel clustering algorithm that effectively combines the scalability benefits from embedding models and the quality from CA models. This graph clustering algorithm has query access to both the CA model and the embedding model, however, we apply a budget on the number of queries made to the CA model. This algorithm uses the CA model to answer edge queries, and benefits from unlimited access to similarity scores from the embedding model. We describe how this proposed setting bridges algorithm design and practical considerations, and can be applied to other clustering problems with similar available scoring functions, such as clustering problems on images and media. We demonstrate how this algorithm yields high-quality clusters with almost a linear number of query calls to the CA model. We have also &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/kwikbucks/kwikbucks.zip"&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt; the data used in our experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="line-height: 40%;"&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The clustering algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The KwikBucks algorithm is an extension of the well-known &lt;a href="https://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/Algo2/Note/kwik.pdf"&gt;KwikCluster algorithm (Pivot algorithm)&lt;/a&gt;. The high-level idea is to first select a set of documents (i.e., centers) with no similarity edge between them, and then form clusters around these centers. To obtain the quality from CA models and the runtime efficiency from embedding models, we introduce the novel &lt;em&gt;combo similarity oracle&lt;/em&gt; mechanism. In this approach, we utilize the embedding model to guide the selection of queries to be sent to the CA model. When given a set of center documents and a target document, the combo similarity oracle mechanism outputs a center from the set that is similar to the target document, if present. The combo similarity oracle enables us to save on budget by limiting the number of query calls to the CA model when selecting centers and forming clusters. It does this by first ranking centers based on their embedding similarity to the target document, and then querying the CA model for the pair (i.e., target document and ranked center), as shown below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRaIWRUaPHb_4QFG2wusDoqrVUJkePKRYgLhU992eEUjnI8gpZ2JzIDBdOEb56zHEBammMVEDj_hgejIhCLcmZK5r8ADTVn54ttrOPnOnR2tuk2J8UVIRQoRc_LOHA56_WnQSWPZbB31dZMkj4VI6btb7NkdUOtM1iM1VAKP5t3F-KiBxXySFb4BrYdPmy/s1601/process.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRaIWRUaPHb_4QFG2wusDoqrVUJkePKRYgLhU992eEUjnI8gpZ2JzIDBdOEb56zHEBammMVEDj_hgejIhCLcmZK5r8ADTVn54ttrOPnOnR2tuk2J8UVIRQoRc_LOHA56_WnQSWPZbB31dZMkj4VI6btb7NkdUOtM1iM1VAKP5t3F-KiBxXySFb4BrYdPmy/s16000/process.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A combo similarity oracle that for a set of documents and a target document, returns a similar document from the set, if present.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

 

&lt;p&gt;
We then perform a post processing step to merge clusters if there is a strong connection between two of them, i.e., when the number of connecting edges is higher than the number of missing edges between two clusters. Additionally, we apply the following steps for further computational savings on queries made to the CA model, and to improve performance at runtime:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We leverage &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11557.pdf"&gt;query-efficient correlation clustering&lt;/a&gt; to form a set of centers from a set of randomly selected documents instead of selecting these centers from all the documents (in the illustration below, the center nodes are red).

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We apply the combo similarity oracle mechanism to perform the cluster assignment step in parallel for all non-center documents and leave documents with no similar center as singletons. In the illustration below, the assignments are depicted by blue arrows and initially two (non-center) nodes are left as singletons due to no assignment. 

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the post-processing step, to ensure scalability, we use the embedding similarity scores to filter down the potential mergers (in the illustration below, the green dashed boundaries show these merged clusters).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1bJ65zsG-PYQwvRncviG5befEFPFhA95xoPUB_QV4hQjvz9vNEi-k4_WfZnMG9-25_t6-lpyNCE2MfD_ZSa6q30CjgBF5iRcmH3n6ThprinvD_Qx6rNCIOYuI4ml2U_rI3qI9q6E5qKW9qL1PKAzkOO6wyr8_kS2iDb_FIx2W7Hgjewh5ms2oe0QClfrj/s1322/Kwikbux%20gif.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1bJ65zsG-PYQwvRncviG5befEFPFhA95xoPUB_QV4hQjvz9vNEi-k4_WfZnMG9-25_t6-lpyNCE2MfD_ZSa6q30CjgBF5iRcmH3n6ThprinvD_Qx6rNCIOYuI4ml2U_rI3qI9q6E5qKW9qL1PKAzkOO6wyr8_kS2iDb_FIx2W7Hgjewh5ms2oe0QClfrj/s16000/Kwikbux%20gif.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Illustration of progress of the clustering algorithm on a given graph instance. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




&lt;br /&gt;

  
&lt;div style="line-height: 40%;"&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
We evaluate the novel clustering algorithm on various datasets with different properties using different embedding-based and cross-attention–based models. We compare the clustering algorithm’s performance with the two best performing baselines (see the &lt;a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=p0JSSa1AuV"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; for more details): 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11557.pdf"&gt;query-efficient correlation clustering&lt;/a&gt; algorithm for budgeted clustering with access to CA only.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering"&gt;Spectral clustering&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_graph"&gt;k-nearest neighbor graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (kNN) formed by querying the CA model for the &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-nearest neighbors of each vertex from embedding-based similarity.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To evaluate the quality of clustering, we use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall"&gt;precision and recall&lt;/a&gt;. Precision is used to calculate the percentage of similar pairs out of all co-clustered pairs and recall is the percentage of co-clustered similar pairs out of all similar pairs. To measure the quality of the obtained solutions from our experiments, we use the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score"&gt;F1-score&lt;/a&gt;, which is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean"&gt;harmonic mean&lt;/a&gt; of the precision and recall, where 1.0 is the highest possible value that indicates perfect precision and recall, and 0 is the lowest possible value that indicates if either precision or recall are zero. The table below reports the F1-score for Kwikbucks and various baselines in the case that we allow only a linear number of queries to the CA model. We show that Kwikbucks offers a substantial boost in performance with a 45% relative improvement compared to the best baseline when averaging across all datasets.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQbrQVGenUUG0sSZ_Ofe9xIiJ068UIBcUCEvH2dUEdji1XMElQJM13RQkuZp2XExktKlpY6VGr6QfujDWyvu9kUlYtIFSV7hKYEgz6D-CUF0Q7UPN4p58EJji5HeVgXfLoAAhatmG74b2zUnewtGKkoyPz9NQIbc43cqKZ35vcyMlJ99PaCdzk1X-WFAqr/s1574/results.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQbrQVGenUUG0sSZ_Ofe9xIiJ068UIBcUCEvH2dUEdji1XMElQJM13RQkuZp2XExktKlpY6VGr6QfujDWyvu9kUlYtIFSV7hKYEgz6D-CUF0Q7UPN4p58EJji5HeVgXfLoAAhatmG74b2zUnewtGKkoyPz9NQIbc43cqKZ35vcyMlJ99PaCdzk1X-WFAqr/s16000/results.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Comparing the clustering algorithm to two baseline algorithms using various public datasets: (1) The &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11557.pdf"&gt;query-efficient correlation clustering&lt;/a&gt; algorithm for budgeted clustering with access to CA only, and (2) &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering"&gt;spectral clustering&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_graph"&gt;k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; formed by querying the CA model for the &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-nearest neighbors of each vertex from embedding-based similarity.

&lt;p&gt;
The figure below compares the clustering algorithm’s performance with baselines using different query budgets. We observe that KwikBucks consistently outperforms other baselines at various budgets.
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Text clustering often presents a dilemma in the choice of similarity function: embedding models are scalable but lack quality, while cross-attention models offer quality but substantially hurt scalability. We present a clustering algorithm that offers the best of both worlds: the scalability of embedding models and the quality of cross-attention models. KwikBucks can also be applied to other clustering problems with multiple similarity oracles of varying accuracy levels. This is validated with an exhaustive set of experiments on various datasets with diverse properties. See the &lt;a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=p0JSSa1AuV"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

&lt;p&gt;
Improving the interoperability of web services is an important and worthy goal. We believe that it should be easier for people to maintain and control their digital identities. And we appreciate that policymakers working on European Union digital certificate legislation, known as eIDAS, are working toward this goal. However, a specific part of the legislation, Article 45, hinders browsers’ ability to enforce certain security requirements on certificates, potentially holding back advances in web security for decades. We and many past and present leaders in the international web community have significant concerns about Article 45's impact on security. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We urge lawmakers to heed the &lt;a href="https://eidas-open-letter.org/" target="_blank"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; of scientists and security experts to revise this part of the legislation rather than erode users’ privacy and security on the web.

      <title>Post Mortem on Cloudflare Control Plane and Analytics Outage</title>
      <link>http://blog.cloudflare.com/post-mortem-on-cloudflare-control-plane-and-analytics-outage/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning on Thursday, November 2, 2023 at 11:43 UTC Cloudflare's control plane and analytics services experienced an outage. The control plane of Cloudflare consists primarily of the customer-facing interface for all of our services including our website and APIs. Our analytics services include logging and analytics reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident lasted from November 2 at 11:44 UTC until November 4 at 04:25 UTC. We were able to restore most of our control plane at our disaster recovery facility as of November 2 at 17:57 UTC. Many customers would not have experienced issues with most of our products after the disaster recovery facility came online. However, other services took longer to restore and customers that used them may have seen issues until we fully resolved the incident. Our raw log services were unavailable for most customers for the duration of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services have now been restored for all customers. Throughout the incident, Cloudflare's network and security services continued to work as expected. While there were periods where customers were unable to make changes to those services, traffic through our network was not impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post outlines the events that caused this incident, the architecture we had in place to prevent issues like this, what failed, what worked and why, and the changes we're making based on what we've learned over the last 36 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, this never should have happened. We believed that we had high availability systems in place that should have stopped an outage like this, even when one of our core data center providers failed catastrophically. And, while many systems did remain online as designed, some critical systems had non-obvious dependencies that made them unavailable. I am sorry and embarrassed for this incident and the pain that it caused our customers and our team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="intended-design"&gt;Intended Design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's control plane and analytics systems run primarily on servers in three data centers around Hillsboro, Oregon. The three data centers are independent of one another, each have multiple utility power feeds, and each have multiple redundant and independent network connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facilities were intentionally chosen to be at a distance apart that would minimize the chances that a natural disaster would cause all three to be impacted, while still close enough that they could all run active-active redundant data clusters. This means that they are continuously syncing data between the three facilities. By design, if any of the facilities goes offline then the remaining ones are able to continue to operate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a system design that we began implementing four years ago. While most of our critical control plane systems had been migrated to the high availability cluster, some services, especially for some newer products, had not yet been added to the high availability cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, our logging systems were intentionally not part of the high availability cluster. The logic of that decision was that logging was already a distributed problem where logs were queued at the edge of our network and then sent back to the core in Oregon (or another regional facility for customers using regional services for logging). If our logging facility was offline then analytics logs would queue at the edge of our network until it came back online. We determined that analytics being delayed was acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="flexential-data-center-power-failure"&gt;Flexential Data Center Power Failure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest of the three facilities in Oregon is run by Flexential. We refer to this facility as “PDX-04.” Cloudflare leases space in PDX-04 where we house our largest analytics cluster as well as more than a third of the machines for our high availability cluster. It is also the default location for services that have not yet been onboarded onto our high availability cluster. We are a relatively large customer of the facility, consuming approximately 10 percent of its total capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="1045" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/11/Flexential-Electrical-System.jpg" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 2 at 08:50 UTC Portland General Electric (PGE), the utility company that services PDX-04, had an unplanned maintenance event affecting one of their independent power feeds into the building. That event shut down one feed into PDX-04. The data center has multiple feeds with some level of independence that can power the facility. However, Flexential powered up their generators to effectively supplement the feed that was down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counter to best practices, Flexential did not inform Cloudflare that they had failed over to generator power. None of our observability tools were able to detect that the source of power had changed. Had they informed us, we would have stood up a team to monitor the facility closely and move control plane services that were dependent on that facility out while it was degraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also unusual that Flexential ran both the one remaining utility feed and the generators at the same time. It is not unusual for utilities to ask data centers to drop off the grid when power demands are high and run exclusively on generators. Flexential operates 10 generators, inclusive of redundant units, capable of supporting the facility at full load. It would also have been possible for Flexential to run the facility only from the remaining utility feed. We haven't gotten a clear answer why they ran utility power and generator power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="informed-speculation-on-what-happened-next"&gt;Informed Speculation On What Happened Next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this decision onward, we don't yet have clarity from Flexential on the root cause or some of the decisions they made or the events. We will update this post as we get more information from Flexential, as well as PGE, on what happened. Some of what follows is informed speculation based on the most likely series of events as well as what individual Flexential employees have shared with us unofficially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible reason they may have left the utility line running is because Flexential was part of a program with PGE called DSG. DSG allows the local utility to run a data center's generators to help supply additional power to the grid. In exchange, the power company helps maintain the generators and supplies fuel. We have been unable to locate any record of Flexential informing us about the DSG program. We've asked if DSG was active at the time and have not received an answer. We do not know if it contributed to the decisions that Flexential made, but it could explain why the utility line continued to remain online after the generators were started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At approximately 11:40 UTC, there was a ground fault on a PGE transformer at PDX-04. We believe, but have not been able to get confirmation from Flexential or PGE, that this was the transformer that stepped down power from the grid for the second feed that was still running as it entered the data center. It seems likely, though we have not been able to confirm with Flexential or PGE, that the ground fault was caused by the unplanned maintenance PGE was performing that impacted the first feed. Or it was a very unlucky coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ground faults with high voltage (12,470 volt) power lines are very bad. Electrical systems are designed to quickly shut down to prevent damage when one occurs. Unfortunately, in this case, the protective measure also shut down all of PDX-04’s generators. This meant that the two sources of power generation for the facility — both the redundant utility lines as well as the 10 generators — were offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in addition to the generators, PDX-04 also contains a bank of UPS batteries. These batteries are supposedly sufficient to power the facility for approximately 10 minutes. That time is meant to be enough to bridge the gap between the power going out and the generators automatically starting up. If Flexential could get the generators or a utility feed restored within 10 minutes then there would be no interruption. In reality, the batteries started to fail after only 4 minutes based on what we observed from our own equipment failing. And it took Flexential far longer than 10 minutes to get the generators restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="attempting-to-restore-power"&gt;Attempting to Restore Power&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we haven't gotten official confirmation, we have been told by employees that three things hampered getting the generators back online. First, they needed to be physically accessed and manually restarted because of the way the ground fault had tripped circuits. Second, Flexential's access control system was not powered by the battery backups so it was offline. And third, the overnight staffing at the site did not include an experienced operations or electrical expert — the overnight shift consisted of security and an unaccompanied technician who had only been on the job for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 11:44 and 12:01 UTC, with the generators not fully restarted, the UPS batteries ran out of power and all customers of the data center lost power. Throughout this, Flexential never informed Cloudflare that there was any issue at the facility. We were first notified of issues in the data center when the two routers that connect the facility to the rest of the world went offline at 11:44 UTC. When we weren't able to reach the routers directly or through out-of-band management, we attempted to contact Flexential and dispatched our local team to physically travel to the facility. The first message to us from Flexential that they were experiencing an issue was at 12:28 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are currently experiencing an issue with power at our [PDX-04] that began at approximately 0500AM PT [12:00 UTC]. Engineers are actively working to resolve the issue and restore service. We will communicate progress every 30 minutes or as more information becomes available as to the estimated time to restore. Thank you for your patience and understanding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 id="designing-for-data-center-level-failure"&gt;Designing for Data Center Level Failure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the PDX-04’s design was certified Tier III before construction and is expected to provide high availability SLAs, we planned for the possibility that it could go offline. Even well-run facilities can have bad days. And we planned for that. What we expected would happen in that case is that our analytics would be offline, logs would be queued at the edge and delayed, and certain lower priority services that were not integrated into our high availability cluster would go offline temporarily until they could be restored at another facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other two data centers running in the area would take over responsibility for the high availability cluster and keep critical services online. Generally that worked as planned. Unfortunately, we discovered that a subset of services that were supposed to be on the high availability cluster had dependencies on services exclusively running in PDX-04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, two critical services that process logs and power our analytics — Kafka and ClickHouse — were only available in PDX-04 but had services that depended on them that were running in the high availability cluster. Those dependencies shouldn’t have been so tight, should have failed more gracefully, and we should have caught them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had performed testing of our high availability cluster by taking offline each (and both) of the other two data center facilities entirely offline. And we had also tested taking the high availability portion of PDX-04 offline. However, we had never tested fully taking the entire PDX-04 facility offline. As a result, we had missed the importance of some of these dependencies on our data plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were also far too lax about requiring new products and their associated databases to integrate with the high availability cluster. Cloudflare allows multiple teams to innovate quickly. As such, products often take different paths toward their initial alpha. While, over time, our practice is to migrate the backend for these services to our best practices, we did not formally require that before products were declared generally available (GA). That was a mistake as it meant that the redundancy protections we had in place worked inconsistently depending on the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, far too many of our services depend on the availability of our core facilities. While this is the way a lot of software services are created, it does not play to Cloudflare’s strength. We are good at distributed systems. Throughout this incident, our global network continued to perform as expected. While some of our products and features are configurable and serviceable through the edge of our network without needing the core, far too many today fail if the core is unavailable. We need to use the distributed systems products that we make available to all our customers for all our services so they continue to function mostly as normal even if our core facilities are disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="disaster-recovery"&gt;Disaster Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 12:48 UTC, Flexential was able to get the generators restarted. Power returned to portions of the facility. In order to not overwhelm the system, when power is restored to a data center it is typically done gradually by powering back on one circuit at a time. Like the circuit breakers in a residential home, each customer is serviced by redundant breakers. When Flexential attempted to power back up Cloudflare's circuits, the circuit breakers were discovered to be faulty. We don't know if the breakers failed due to the ground fault or some other surge as a result of the incident, or if they'd been bad before and it was only discovered after they had been powered off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexential began the process of replacing the failed breakers. That required them to source new breakers because more were bad than they had on hand in the facility. Because more services were offline than we expected, and because Flexential could not give us a time for restoration of our services, we made the call at 13:40 UTC to fail over to Cloudflare's disaster recovery sites located in Europe. Thankfully, we only needed to fail over a small percentage of Cloudflare’s overall control plane. Most of our services continued to run across our high availability systems across the two active core data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We turned up the first services on the disaster recovery site at 13:43 UTC.Cloudflare's disaster recovery sites provide critical control plane services in the event of a disaster. While the disaster recovery site does not support some of our log processing services, it is designed to support the other portions of our control plane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When services were turned up there, we experienced a thundering herd problem where the API calls that had been failing overwhelmed our services. We implemented rate limits to get the request volume under control. During this period, customers of most products would have seen intermittent errors when making modifications through our dashboard or API. By 17:57 UTC, the services that had been successfully moved to the disaster recovery site were stable and most customers were no longer directly impacted. However, some systems still required manual configuration (e.g., Magic WAN) and some other services, largely related to log processing and some bespoke APIs, remained unavailable until we were able to restore PDX-04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="some-products-and-features-delayed-restart"&gt;Some Products and Features Delayed Restart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of products did not properly get stood up on our disaster recovery sites. These tended to be newer products where we had not fully implemented and tested a disaster recovery procedure. These included our Stream service for uploading new videos and some other services. Our team worked two simultaneous tracks to get these services restored: 1) reimplementing them on our disaster recovery sites; and 2) migrating them to our high-availability cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexential replaced our failed circuit breakers, restored both utility feeds, and confirmed clean power at 22:48 UTC. Our team was all-hands-on-deck and had worked all day on the emergency, so I made the call that most of us should get some rest and start the move back to PDX-04 in the morning. That decision delayed our full recovery, but I believe made it less likely that we’d compound this situation with additional mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning first thing on November 3, our team began restoring service in PDX-04. That began with physically booting our network gear then powering up thousands of servers and restoring their services. The state of our services in the data center was unknown as we believed multiple power cycles were likely to have occurred during the incident. Our only safe process to recover was to follow a complete bootstrap of the entire facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This involved a manual process of bringing our configuration management servers online to begin the restoration of the facility. Rebuilding these took 3 hours. From there, our team was able to bootstrap the rebuild of the rest of the servers that power our services. Each server took between 10 minutes and 2 hours to rebuild. While we were able to run this in parallel across multiple servers, there were inherent dependencies between services that required some to be brought back online in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services are now fully restored as of November 4 at 04:25 UTC. For most customers, because of how we queue analytics at the edge, you should see no data loss in your analytics. Any gaps that appear as of now we expect will fill in as any lingering caches of analytics data is ingested. For customers that use our log push feature, your logs will not have been processed for the majority of the event, so anything you did not receive will not be recovered. However, the records in our analytics dashboard will still be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="lessons-and-remediation"&gt;Lessons and Remediation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a number of questions that we need answered from Flexential. But we also must expect that entire data centers may fail. Google has a process where when there’s a significant event or crisis they can call a Code Yellow or Code Red. In these cases, most or all engineering resources are shifted to addressing the issue at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have not had such a process in the past, but it’s clear today we need to implement a version of it ourselves: Code Orange. We are shifting all non-critical engineering functions to focusing on ensuring high reliability of our control plane. As part of that, we expect the following changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove dependencies on our core data centers for control plane configuration of all services and move them wherever possible to be powered first by our distributed network&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the control plane running on the network continues to function even if all our core data centers are offline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Require that all products and features that are designated Generally Available must rely on the high availability cluster (if they rely on any of our core data centers), without having any software dependencies on specific facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Require all products and features that are designated Generally Available have a reliable disaster recovery plan that is tested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test the blast radius of system failures and minimize the number of services that are impacted by a failure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement more rigorous chaos testing of all data center functions including the full removal of each of our core data center facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thorough auditing of all core data centers and a plan to reaudit to ensure they comply with our standards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logging and analytics disaster recovery plan that ensures no logs are dropped even in the case of a failure of all our core facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, I am sorry and embarrassed for this incident and the pain that it caused our customers and our team. We have the right systems and procedures in place to be able to withstand even the cascading string of failures we saw at our data center provider, but we need to be more rigorous about enforcing that they are followed and tested for unknown dependencies. This will have my full attention and the attention of a large portion of our team through the balance of the year. And the pain from the last couple days will make us better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
