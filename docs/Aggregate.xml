Developers, admins, and architects will discover how to build the next generation of AI apps for the Einstein 1 Platform, get hands-on with core platform products and features, and learn directly from product owners and technical experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, we want to invite you, the Trailblazer Community, to share your expertise and experience at TrailblazerDX 2024. Today, the &lt;a href="https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tdx24/sessionproposal/cfpHome"&gt;TrailblazerDX 2024 Call for Participation is officially open&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re looking forward to receiving your submissions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TrailblazerDX 2024 Call for Participation will remain open until Friday, December 1, 2023, at 11:59 p.m. PT. We will inform all submitters of their acceptance status in late December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that our technical audience has the opportunity to learn directly from our internal product experts and engineers, the majority of TrailblazerDX 2024 sessions will be presented by internal Salesforce presenters. However, we have a small, dedicated, customer speaker track to create opportunities for our Trailbazer community to share your insights and learn from one another. Please be advised that the number of sessions accepted through this CFP process will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why should YOU present at TrailblazerDX 2024?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TrailblazerDX 2024 is an opportunity to share your expertise and experience with our AI and core platform products. If you have implementation best practices, solution stories, or career advice, share your session idea with us! Presenting at TrailblazerDX is a great way to showcase your Salesforce expertise, strengthen your personal brand, and connect with the Salesforce technical community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What types of sessions should you submit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Community Campfire (20 minutes):&lt;/b&gt; These are small, interactive sessions that connect attendees with community leaders and product experts to spotlight the skills, expertise, and learnings that can help elevate a Trailblazer’s career in the Salesforce ecosystem. These sessions are conversation-focused and in a smaller venue, so they should not include demos and only use a limited number of slides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theater (20 minutes): &lt;/b&gt;Theater sessions&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;show technical solutions, demos, and technical expertise. These sessions can deep dive into a specific product area or showcase how you built a solution across many features. While this format typically doesn’t allow time for Q&amp;amp;A or discussion, speakers are encouraged to answer attendee questions after their presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breakout (40 minutes):&lt;/b&gt; Breakout sessions are held in dedicated session rooms with a larger capacity. Breakout sessions are in 40-minute blocks, which gives you enough time to dive deep into a topic. The format also allows audience members to engage with you and ask questions. We recommend that you plan 30 minutes for your presentation, leaving the last 10 minutes for questions and discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deep-dive Panel (75 minutes)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; These are longer technical presentations with time for an accompanying Q&amp;amp;A. These sessions are allotted a 75-minute block. In the first 25 minutes, you will demo a real-world technical project that you have been involved in. You can present a project that required a complex code solution, a solution that combined low-code and code effectively, an innovative DevOps implementation, or any project-oriented technical deep-dive that you would like to share. In the next 50 minutes, the speaker will take questions from the audience and a panel of experts, who will help drive deeper conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What topics are we looking for at TrailblazerDX 2024?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for engaging expert sessions that provide content to help our technical audiences (admins, architects, and developers) build their skills, elevate their careers, and deliver innovative technology solutions for their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas for sessions that we’d like to see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speak on a technical topic where you have&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; deep expertise and experience.&lt;/b&gt; This could be about a specific feature, a solution you built, or something you feel strongly about that is supported by your personal experience. The first step in getting your audience to love listening to you is for you to love what you are saying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Share how you are using generative AI in your work.&lt;/b&gt; Whether you are building workstreams and solutions with a Salesforce AI product or a technology partner like OpenAI or Anthropic, tell us how you are implementing AI-driven apps and using AI to assist your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Share your expertise with new and established Salesforce features.&lt;/b&gt; If you have tried some of the latest Salesforce innovations, such as the new AI, Data Cloud, or automation features, consider sharing your experience with them. If you’ve had access to a pilot or beta regarding the Salesforce Platform, then you may be in a position to share your unique insight on upcoming features and changes. We are also looking for content around &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; Salesforce developer, admin, and architect topics, including well-known and established technologies, such as Apex and Flow. Great sessions about these topics are typically very successful, and hard to find, so, don’t be afraid of submitting your ideas!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Share your tips &amp;amp; tricks and inspirational career insights. &lt;/b&gt;Have a topic that doesn’t require slides or a demo? The Community Campfire is a great place for sharing advice on networking, overcoming workplace obstacles, using AI in your job search, and any conversational topic that will help Trailblazers excel in their careers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Session proposal submission process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure how to get started, we recommend that you follow the guidance below when crafting your title, abstract, and other submission fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s start with the &lt;b&gt;Session Title &lt;/b&gt;field (60-character limit). It should be something that will interest your target technical audience (developers, admins, or architects). Make it very clear to attendees what they’ll learn. &lt;i&gt;Top tip: Start with a verb and include the product or technology name in the title, so it’s crystal clear to your audience.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: “Unlock the Power of Einstein for Developers”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Session Abstract&lt;/b&gt; field (200-character limit) is where you’ll write a short paragraph to quickly tell us what you’re going to talk about. Be creative! Don’t just explain your slide deck, but share your ideas for interacting with the audience. What are you going to build or demo? What discussion will you lead? What will your audience take home with them and share with their teams? Address the WIIFM (what’s in it for me) benefits. &lt;i&gt;Top tip: a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ccuracy and honesty are more important than popularity. &lt;/i&gt;Be careful with AI-generated titles and abstracts as they can feel inauthentic and impersonal. For more writing tips, check out our &lt;a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/trailhead-voice-and-tone-quick-look/learn-why-we-write-the-way-we-do"&gt;Trailhead module on voice and tone&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: “Generative AI has taken the tech world by storm. Learn about Einstein, its latest capabilities, and how developers can use the technology to build their own AI-powered applications on Salesforce.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Why Should This Session Be Presented &lt;/b&gt;field&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(1000-character limit) is to further explain your abstract. Use this field to share any additional relevant details not included in the abstract. Frequently, this content helps us make a final decision regarding session selection.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: “This is a topic that I have a lot of experience on as I’ve been involved in three customer implementations where data security in Experience Cloud was key. These are the main takeaways that I would share in my presentation at TrailblazerDX ‘24: [ &amp;#8230; ]. This will be the structure of the talk [ &amp;#8230; ]. I’ve presented about this topic before, and the session was very successful, you can read some feedback I received here [ &amp;#8230; ].”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;b&gt;Level &lt;/b&gt;field (picklist) that best applies to the technical expertise of your target audience. We want to have a balance of introductory, intermediate, and advanced sessions, so this information can be key for your session to be selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &lt;b&gt;Who Is Your Primary Audience&lt;/b&gt; field (picklist), select the appropriate audience for your session:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Developer” for content most relevant to developers and people who code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Administrator” for content most relevant to admins, and people building with low-code or no-code features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Architect” for content that is focused on architecture skills and knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have more than one topic that you’d like to propose, please complete the submission process again for each topic. Please do not submit the same topic to multiple tracks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TrailblazerDX receives hundreds of proposals to fill a very small number of speaking spots. Therefore, as you create your session title and abstract, think about how you can make yours stand out from the rest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll review your session proposal and make selections to ensure that we have the right mix of content for technical audiences. We’ll notify you of your submission status in late December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your session is accepted, one of our content owners will guide you through the preparation process, which includes feedback on your content, slide review, and rehearsal sessions. You will also receive a speaker pass to attend TrailblazerDX 2024. If you’ve already registered to attend, you will receive instructions on how to either refund that registration or transfer it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your session is not accepted, there are other events, including &lt;a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/community/conferences"&gt;community conferences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/"&gt;developer group meet-ups&lt;/a&gt; that may be interested in having you present your content!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cryptol, SAW, and the Galois Origin Story</title>
      <link>https://galois.com/blog/2023/11/cryptol-saw-and-the-galois-origin-story/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galois&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptol和SAW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;加密算法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;开源工具&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;形式验证&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptol和SAW是Galois公司的创新产品，为国家安全、金融技术和云计算应用提供了开源验证工具。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptol在AES算法的选择中发挥了重要作用，帮助美国政府分析和比较不同的加密算法，最终选择了Rijndael算法作为全球标准。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptol和SAW的开源使其受到了广泛的关注和采用，用户群体不断增长。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAW的诞生解决了对复杂算法的形式验证难题，为查找和修复深层次代码问题提供了帮助。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galois和AWS合作，通过Cryptol和SAW保证了AWS云计算服务的安全性和隐私，并扩大了这些工具的全球应用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptol和SAW的使用正在不断增长，对于处理日益复杂的系统安全问题具有广阔的应用前景。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galois公司的Cryptol和SAW是开源的验证工具，通过对加密算法进行形式验证，确保了国家安全、金融技术和云计算应用的安全和隐私保护。Cryptol在AES算法的选择中起到了重要作用，而SAW解决了复杂算法的形式验证难题。开源使得这些工具受到了广泛的关注和采用，其在AWS云计算服务中的应用进一步扩大了其影响力。随着系统的复杂性和互联性的增加，Cryptol和SAW具有广阔的应用前景。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the many tales of innovation and impact to come from Galois over the years, the origin story of &lt;a href="https://cryptol.net/"&gt;Cryptol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://saw.galois.com/"&gt;SAW&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most closely tied with that of the company itself. Today, these open-source verification tools have been used in national security, fintech, and cloud computing applications to keep citizens, systems, and data safe; secure financial transactions; and protect the privacy of millions of people across the globe. The high assurance approach they represent forms the backbone—both technologically and philosophically—of Galois’s larger effort to create trustworthiness in the most critical systems on the planet, and to maximize impact through sharing these powerful tools with the open source community. But in the early days, no one could have even dreamed of all that was to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://galois.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Paragraph_Monger_abstract_representation_of_a_cryptographic_lan_6226f9b5-7d5c-4063-ad11-b2c7802382e2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-4927" height="1024" src="https://galois.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Paragraph_Monger_abstract_representation_of_a_cryptographic_lan_6226f9b5-7d5c-4063-ad11-b2c7802382e2.png" style="width: 525px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in the late 1990s, Galois founder John Launchbury was still a computer science professor at the Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI). By that point in his career, Launchbury was consulting for the National Security Agency (NSA), including working with OGI colleagues to model a programmable cryptography chip.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It could handle multiple cryptographic algorithms with a guaranteed cleaning out of all the registers, and had a mathematically-assured kernel in the chip itself,” Launchbury said. “It was pretty cool, but they didn’t have the technology to be able to model the correctness of their algorithms. At OGI, we showed that it was possible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results soon circulated through government R&amp;amp;D circles. Impressed, and seeing the potential for a tool with a broader impact, a government contact approached Launchbury about creating a domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying cryptographic algorithms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My first reaction was, ‘That would be cool, but I’m hesitant to do it,’” Launchbury said. “At the university, we had tried building things in the past, but there’s a conflict between focusing on actually building a good product and focusing on publishable research. When you try to do both, you end up with neither great research nor a good product.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the idea of developing a crypto-focused DSL was too intriguing, and Launchbury couldn’t let it go. If it wouldn’t work to do it at the university, perhaps there was another way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past, Launchbury and his colleagues had discussed the possibility of starting companies to commercialize and productize the technologies and innovations from their academic research. This seemed the perfect opportunity. And so, in 1999, Launchbury founded Galois. Developing the crypto-focused DSL for the U.S. Government was their very first contract. They called it: “Cryptol.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting the Standard for Advanced Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Galois’s brand new tool was almost immediately put to work helping the government decide on a new gold standard for cryptographic encryption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the early 1970s, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) had been the NSA’s officially approved symmetric key algorithm for cryptography applications. But by the late ‘90s, DES’s 56 bits of security was viewed as too vulnerable for increasingly complex and software-heavy systems. In 1997, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) spread the word in the cryptography community that they were in the market for a replacement. In the years that followed, more than a dozen designs were submitted for consideration as the new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), each a block cipher algorithm in 128, 192, or 256-bit key sizes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just as Galois was being formed, the competition had been whittled down to 10 finalists, and the government wanted to be able to better analyze and understand the algorithms in order to make a more informed decision. Cryptol became a key part of NIST and the U.S. government&amp;#8217;s decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That was some of our earliest work,” said Launchbury. “Nowadays these algorithms are so well known, but back then they were very new. We used Cryptol to express these algorithms at a very high level that allowed people to understand their structure and explore their behavior.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because Cryptol empowers users to create a precise mathematical model of a cryptographic algorithm, it served as an invaluable tool by which the government’s mathematically-minded cryptographers could make sense of the AES candidates—mapping specifications and comparing them to implementations to demonstrate correctness and root out potential problems. With Cryptol as a part of their toolset, NIST and the NSA were able to choose a winning symmetric encryption algorithm, the Rijndael algorithm. Today, Rijndael, now branded as AES, continues to be widely recognized and accepted as the global standard for symmetric encryption in a broad spectrum of applications and environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Sourcing Cryptol and Uncovering New Capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, it was well understood that the R&amp;amp;D community, the industry, and the public at large can benefit when tools like Cryptol are open sourced. In addition, it was known that open sourced tools could themselves benefit from and be independently verified by a broad, diverse user community. With this in mind, the U.S. Government and Galois agreed to open source Cryptol for broad application and public benefit, releasing the first fully public version (&lt;a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol/releases?page=3"&gt;Cryptol 2&lt;/a&gt;) in 2014. With Cryptol’s source code available for anyone to explore and use, adoption and collaboration began to increase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bit by bit, Cryptol was proving its mettle and making its mark, and Launchbury and his fellow researchers were uncovering more and more applications—including the ability to generate or analyze hardware circuits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It turns out that you can generate logic from a Cryptol specification,” Launchbury explained. “And if I’ve got a descriptor of a hardware circuit, I can also turn that into logic. And so now I’ve got two logic circuits that I can compare against one another and ask: ‘Are they equal to one another?’”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus a new “backend” to Cryptol was born—one that could generate and understand hardware designs written in a language called VHDL.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the tool was only initially used by a handful of individuals within the government, the speed at which Cryptol could be used to generate test vectors (inputs used to test system correctness), study algorithmic behavior, and root out problems hidden deep within complex code slowly began to catch people’s attention, and the grassroots user base began to grow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I started to hear that hundreds of people in the government were using Cryptol for all sorts of wonderful things,” Launchbury said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Galois continued to grow, not only researching and developing more tools and technologies, but expanding Cryptol’s reach. Soon, other organizations and government agencies expressed interest—wanting to use the tool to better analyze, understand, and improve their own cryptographic algorithms as well as those made or used by vendors. Cryptol’s use extended to commercial companies who used Cryptol internally or worked with Galois to apply Cryptol to their next generation cryptographic products.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Let’s say a vendor is supplying you with equipment, and they say, ‘This equipment correctly implements such and such an algorithm,’” Launchbury said. “You can use Cryptol to gain confidence in the equipment being supplied—figuring out early on whether there’s a flaw deep in the code. It would give you that kind of answer instantaneously so that you can correct any flaws before a system is fielded.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verifying Elliptic Curve Algorithms and the Creation of SAW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, Cryptol was steadily becoming a key tool for the U.S. government assessing code in their critical systems. All that time, cyber-physical systems (systems that integrate hardware, software, networking, and physical processes) and the algorithms used to secure them from growing threats were becoming more and more complex—making it more and more difficult for conventional testing methods to keep up. Cryptol evolved right alongside, keeping pace every step of the way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a new class of cryptographic algorithms called “elliptic curve algorithms” arrived on the scene, they presented a puzzle far more challenging than that posed by AES. Galois set out to specify several versions of these enormously complex algorithms, including the de facto standard open source Java implementation that was a part of the “Bouncy Castle” cryptography library. Using Cryptol, Galois was able to show that there was an exploitable error deep in the arithmetic of Bouncy Castle’s implementation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;#8217;s one of those cases where you really needed to do real verification work,” Launchbury said. “These algorithms were so complex that we couldn’t simply create a whole logic description and show equivalence. We had to start modeling their structures, showing subpart equivalents, and subparts equivalents of those subparts, and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to analyze an implementation using Cryptol, Galois needed some means by which to bridge the gap between a mathematical specification in Cryptol and a software implementation written in a variety of programming languages, not just in a hardware design language like VHDL. In response, Galois created the Software Analysis Workbench (SAW), which allows more control over SAT and SMT solvers to enable them to formally verify properties of code written in C, Java, and Cryptol—automating as much of the verification process as possible and enabling the process to scale to complex systems.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Before long, SAW caught the interest of Amazon Web Services (AWS).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Amazon Catalyst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AWS’s global cloud infrastructure serves small businesses, large companies, individuals, and government agencies in more than 245 countries and territories across the globe. They’re responsible for hosting some of the most valuable data in the world—a high stakes task that demands &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; security and privacy, all without compromising high performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2015, Galois worked alongside AWS Cryptography, applying an approach called “provable security” to mathematically guarantee that particular security flaws cannot happen in some of the key cryptographic systems that protect their cloud. By integrating Cryptol and SAW into their CI/CD pipeline, Galois was able to provide continuous, automatic verification of AWS’s cryptographic library &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; time they updated their code. The result was provable security protecting critical data for millions of active customers. The AWS use case and global deployment demonstrated the power of automated reasoning tools and their ability to scale into real world, global deployments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That was the first time that anyone had demonstrated continually maintained code infrastructure over many iterations of CI/CD,” Launchbury said. “98% of the time the whole process was automatic. That was a huge improvement, and it caught the attention of operational groups in the government. Federal agencies basically said: ‘Well, if Amazon is using this, why aren’t we?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking to the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the years since, Cryptol and SAW’s applications and impact have only continued to grow. Galois continued to contribute feature enhancements and extensions to the open source tools, including the ability to generate high-performance, high-assurance implementations from Cryptol specifications or SAW intermediate representations.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Reports came in from government and commercial clients that Cryptol and SAW were uncovering problems “that no other tools have found.” Later, when NIST launched the Post Quantum Algorithm competition, Galois modeled and verified several algorithms for customers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, Cryptol and SAW are being actively used across government and industry to secure some of the most valuable data in the world and for a number of tangible national security applications. That impact is quite significant, but Launchbury still considers it just the tip of the iceberg in terms of&amp;nbsp; the potential that tools like SAW and Cryptol present—particularly in our current context of growing system complexity and interconnectivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We live in an increasingly connected world where lots and lots of devices are connected that weren’t before. Right now, your car is likely connected to the internet, but soon your car will be connected to the cars next to it and to the road itself. That’s a quantum leap of connectivity. And as you add capability and connectivity, you get a perfect storm for challenges—exactly the sort of challenges that these approaches are built to handle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Verifying the security of systems with that level of complexity through conventional techniques is increasingly difficult or even impossible. Formal verification, through tools like Cryptol and SAW, makes future-proofed scalable security a reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TECHNICAL EPILOGUE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under the Hood: Applying SAW to different programming languages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, in order to analyze implementations using Cryptol, Galois needed some means by which to bridge the gap between a mathematical specification in Cryptol and a software implementation written in a variety of programming languages. Most deployed cryptography is written in software in programming languages like C and Java, or in assembly language. In order to reason about those implementations, Galois created the Software Analysis Workbench (SAW)&amp;nbsp; which could automatically lift models out of implementations, and then compare those lifted models to each other, or with Cryptol models.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than writing a “lifter” for every new programming language, this “lifting” focuses on widely used intermediate representations (IR) that are used for many programming languages. Initially SAW supported the &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/"&gt;LLVM compiler infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;’s IR, and later was extended to support understanding the &lt;a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html"&gt;Java Virtual Machine bytecode format&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By supporting these two IRs, suddenly one could use SAW to attempt to reason about not just C or Java code, but any compiler that uses LLVM or the JVM as a backend, such as Rust, C++, Kotlin, Scala, and more. What’s more, after implementing two compiler backends, adding support for others became more straightforward.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the years, support was added also for programming language IRs like MATLAB and Ghidra P-code, and hardware design languages like Verilog and Bluespec SystemVerilog. These advancements meant it was possible to begin to reason about optimized, complex implementations of new kinds of cryptographic primitives, such as elliptic curves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptol and SAW for Implementation and Assurance Case Generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the advancements in specification and program reasoning discussed above, new features in Cryptol and SAW were also added in order to generate implementations from Cryptol specifications or SAW IR representations, as well as to generate test benches from specifications.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Backends now exist to generate high-performance, formally verifiable C, LLVM bitcode, JVM, and Verilog implementations.&amp;nbsp; These implementations have been used in two ways: (1) as “golden models” for further manual or automated refinement, such as performance or resource use optimizations, or (2) directly as deployable implementations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several case studies have demonstrated that the implementations automatically generated by these tools are extremely competitive with all public hand-written-by-experts (with great effort and cost) implementations, especially when compared using throughput, latency, and energy benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The convenience of System.IO</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-convenience-of-system-io/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文件API&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读取文本文件&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;性能&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;编码&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;高级API&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“文件API”部分介绍了在.NET开发中访问文件的一些常用API，包括File、FileInfo、FileStream等。阐述了这些API在读取文本文件时的便利性和性能。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“性能”部分介绍了不同API在大型小说中进行行数、单词数和字节数统计的性能比较。高级API相对简单易用且性能也不错，而低级API虽然需要一些额外的工作，但性能非常出色。此外，还展示了使用本机AOT编译的.NET应用的新性能。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“编码”部分介绍了.NET中处理和存储文本的多种类型，如Char、Encoding、Rune和String，并解释了Unicode的一些概念和编码方式。阐述了这些类型在性能测试中的应用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“总结”部分强调了System.IO提供的API在不同场景下的适用性。高级API对于小型文件或不需要考虑内存使用的情况非常方便，而低级API则提供了更高的控制和性能，特别适合处理大型和非文本文件。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文介绍了.NET中的文件API和文本处理API，比较了它们在读取文本文件时的便利性和性能。高级API提供了一些简化的方法用于对文本进行统计，而低级API则需要更多的努力但能够实现更好的性能。此外，文章还讨论了处理文本编码和Unicode的相关概念，并探讨了不同编码对性能的影响。总的来说，System.IO提供的API在不同场景下都有其适用性，开发者可根据需要灵活选择使用。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reading and writing files is very common, just like other forms of I/O. File APIs are needed for reading application configuration, caching content, and loading data (from disk) into memory to do some computation like (today&amp;#8217;s topic) word counting. &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FileInfo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FileStream&lt;/code&gt;, and related types do a lot of the heavy lifting for .NET developers needing to access files. In this post, we’re going to look at the convenience and performance of reading text files with &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io"&gt;System.IO&lt;/a&gt;, with some help from &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.text"&gt;System.Text&lt;/a&gt; APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently kicked off a series on the &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-convenience-of-dotnet/"&gt;Convenience of .NET&lt;/a&gt; that describes our approach for providing convenient solutions to common tasks. &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-convenience-of-system-text-json/"&gt;The convenience of System.Text.Json&lt;/a&gt; is another post in the series, about reading and writing JSON documents. &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/why-dotnet/"&gt;Why .NET?&lt;/a&gt; describes the architectural choices that enable the solutions covered in these posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post analyzes the convenience and performance of file I/O and text APIs being put to the task of counting lines, words, and bytes in a large novel. The results show that the high-level APIs are straightforward to use and deliver great performance, while the lower-level APIs require a little more effort and deliver excellent results. You&amp;#8217;ll also see how &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot"&gt;native AOT&lt;/a&gt; shifts .NET into a new class of performance for application startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-apis"&gt;The APIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; APIs (with their companions) are used in the benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.file.openhandle"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.OpenHandle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.randomaccess.read"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RandomAccess.Read&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.file.open"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.Open&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.filestream.read"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileStream.Read&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.file.opentext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.streamreader.read"&gt;&lt;code&gt;StreamReader.Read&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.streamreader.readline"&gt;&lt;code&gt;StreamReader.ReadLine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.file.readlines"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.ReadLines&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1"&gt;&lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.file.readalllines"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.ReadAllLines&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.array"&gt;&lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The APIs are listed from highest-control to most convenient. It&amp;#8217;s OK if they are new to you. It should still be an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower-level benchmarks rely on the following &lt;code&gt;System.Text&lt;/code&gt; types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding"&gt;Encoding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.text.rune"&gt;Rune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also used the new &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.buffers.searchvalues"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; class to see if it provided a significant benefit over passing a &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;.IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt;. It pre-computes the search strategy to avoid the upfront costs of &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.memoryextensions.indexofany"&gt;&lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spoiler: the impact is dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll look at an app that has been implemented multiple times — for each of those APIs — testing approachability and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-app"&gt;The App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/tree/main/wordcount/wordcount"&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; counts lines, words, and bytes in a text file. It is modeled on the behavior of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wc_(Unix)"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a popular tool available on Unix-like systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word counting is an algorithm that requires looking at every character in a file. The counting is done by counting spaces and line breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word is a non-zero-length sequence of printable characters delimited by white space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s from &lt;code&gt;wc --help&lt;/code&gt;. The app code need to follows that recipe. Seems straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmarks count words in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa"&gt;Clarissa Harlowe; or the history of a young lady&lt;/a&gt; by Samuel Richardson. This text was chosen because it is apparently one of the longest books in the English language and is &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/1959"&gt;freely available on Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#8217;s even a &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101066/"&gt;BBC TV adaption&lt;/a&gt; of it from 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did some testing with &lt;a href="https://dev.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/85"&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/a&gt;, another long text. Sadly, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Valjean"&gt;&lt;code&gt;24601&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t come up as a word count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each implementation is measured in terms of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lines of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed of execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m using a build of .NET 8 very close to the final GA build. While writing this post, I saw that there was another .NET 8 build still coming, however, the build I used is probably within the last two or three builds of final for the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="https://benchmarkdotnet.org/index.html"&gt;BenchmarkDotNet&lt;/a&gt; for performance testing. It&amp;#8217;s a great tool if you&amp;#8217;ve never used it. Writing a benchmark is similar to writing a unit test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following use of &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; lists the cores on my Linux machine. Each core gets its own line in the &lt;code&gt;/proc/cpuinfo&lt;/code&gt; file with &amp;#8220;model name&amp;#8221; appearing in each of those lines and &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; counts lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | wc -l
8
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | head -n 1
model name  : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz
$ cat /etc/os-release | head -n 1
NAME="Manjaro Linux"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used that machine for the performance testing in this post. You can see I&amp;#8217;m using Manjaro Linux, which is part of the Arch Linux family. .NET 8 is already available in the &lt;a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet-sdk-preview-bin"&gt;Arch User Repository&lt;/a&gt; (which is also available to Manjaro users).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lines-of-code"&gt;Lines of code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love solutions that are easy and approachable. Lines of code is our best proxy metric for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/file-api-approachability-loc.png" title="File API lines of code metric" width="75%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two clusters in this chart, at ~35 and ~75 lines. You&amp;#8217;ll see that these benchmarks boil down to two algorithms with some small differences to accomodate the different APIs. In contrast, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/wc.c"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; implementation&lt;/a&gt; is quite a bit longer, nearing 1000 lines. It does more, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; to calculate the Benchmark line counts, again with &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;$ wc -l *Benchmark.cs
      73 FileOpenCharSearchValuesBenchmark.cs
      71 FileOpenHandleAsciiCheatBenchmark.cs
      74 FileOpenHandleCharSearchValuesBenchmark.cs
      60 FileOpenHandleRuneBenchmark.cs
      45 FileOpenTextCharBenchmark.cs
      65 FileOpenTextCharIndexOfAnyBenchmark.cs
      84 FileOpenTextCharLinesBenchmark.cs
      65 FileOpenTextCharSearchValuesBenchmark.cs
      34 FileOpenTextReadLineBenchmark.cs
      36 FileOpenTextReadLineSearchValuesBenchmark.cs
      32 FileReadAllLinesBenchmark.cs
      32 FileReadLinesBenchmark.cs
     671 total&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote several benchmarks. I summarized those in the image above, using the best performing benchmark for each file API (and then shortened the name for simplicity). The full set of benchmarks will get covered later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="functional-parity-with-wc"&gt;Functional parity with &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s validate that my C# implementation matches &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;$  wc ../Clarissa_Harlowe/*

&lt;p&gt;The results are effectively identical, with a one word difference in total wordcount. Here, you are seeing a Linux version of &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;. The macOS version reported &lt;code&gt;985716&lt;/code&gt; words, three words different than the Linux implementation. I noticed that there were some special characters in two of the files that were causing these differences. I didn&amp;#8217;t spend more time investigating them since its outside of the scope of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="scan-the-summary-in-10-microseconds"&gt;Scan the summary (in 10 microseconds)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by testing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/Clarissa_Harlowe/summary.md"&gt;short summary&lt;/a&gt; of the novel. It&amp;#8217;s just 1 kilobyte (with 9 lines and 153 words).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;$ dotnet run ../Clarissa_Harlowe/summary.md 
        9     153    1044 ../Clarissa_Harlowe/summary.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s count some words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/file-api-speed-small-document.png" title="Speed metrics for reading small document using .NET File I/O APIs" width="75%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to call this result a tie. There are not a lot of apps where a 1 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_time#List"&gt;microsecond&lt;/a&gt; gap in performance matters. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t write tens of additional lines of code for (only) that win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="team-byte-wins-the-memory-race-with-team-string"&gt;Team &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; wins the memory race with Team &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s look at memory usage for the same small document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/file-api-memory-small-document.png" title="Memory metrics for reading small document using .NET File I/O APIs" width="75%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;1_048_576&lt;/code&gt; bytes is 1 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte"&gt;megabyte (mebibyte)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;10_000&lt;/code&gt; bytes is 1% of that. Note: I&amp;#8217;m using the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/integral-numeric-types#integer-literals"&gt;integer literal&lt;/a&gt; format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are seeing one cluster of APIs that return bytes and another that returns heap-allocated strings. In the middle, &lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt; relies on the &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FileStream&lt;/code&gt; classes to do the required processing. The &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; returning APIs rely on the same types. The &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt; object used by these APIs allocate several buffers, including a 1k buffer. It also creates a &lt;code&gt;FileStream&lt;/code&gt; object, which by default allocates a 4k buffer. For &lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt; (when using &lt;code&gt;StreamReader.Read&lt;/code&gt;), those buffers are a fixed cost while &lt;code&gt;File.ReadLines&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;File.ReadAllLines&lt;/code&gt; also allocate strings (one per line; a variable cost).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="speed-reading-the-book-in-1-millisecond"&gt;Speed reading the book (in 1 millisecond)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s see how long it takes to count lines, words, and bytes in &lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/Clarissa_Harlowe/clarissa_volume1.txt"&gt;Clarissa_Harlowe volume one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;$ dotnet run ../Clarissa_Harlowe/clarissa_volume1.txt
    11716  110023  610515 ../Clarissa_Harlowe/clarissa_volume1.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we&amp;#8217;ll see a larger separation in performance, grinding through &lt;code&gt;610_515&lt;/code&gt; bytes of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/file-api-speed-large-document.png" title="Speed metrics for reading large document using .NET File I/O APIs" width="75%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we do. The &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; returning APIs cluster together, just above 1ms. We&amp;#8217;re also now seeing a difference between &lt;code&gt;File.ReadLine&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;File.ReadAllLines&lt;/code&gt;. However, we should put in perspective that the gap is only 2ms for 600k of text. The high-level APIs are doing a great job of delivering competitive performance with much simpler algorithms (in the code I wrote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in &lt;code&gt;File.ReadLine&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;File.ReadAllLines&lt;/code&gt; is worth a bit more explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the APIs start with bytes. &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b6b00ec9f606eca0c47e01b30e74ee0d37d561ab/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/File.cs#L770-L775"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.ReadLines&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reads &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b6b00ec9f606eca0c47e01b30e74ee0d37d561ab/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/StreamReader.cs#L644"&gt;bytes into &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; values&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b6b00ec9f606eca0c47e01b30e74ee0d37d561ab/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/StreamReader.cs#L815"&gt;looks for the next line break&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b6b00ec9f606eca0c47e01b30e74ee0d37d561ab/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/StreamReader.cs#L819-L827"&gt;converts that block of text to a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b6b00ec9f606eca0c47e01b30e74ee0d37d561ab/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/ReadLinesIterator.cs#L50-L52"&gt;returning one at a time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b6b00ec9f606eca0c47e01b30e74ee0d37d561ab/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/File.cs#L751-L765"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.ReadAllLines&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; does the same and additionally creates all &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; lines at once and packages them all up into a &lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;. That&amp;#8217;s a LOT of upfront work that requires a lot of additional memory that frequently offers no additional value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt; returns a &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt;, which exposes &lt;code&gt;ReadLine&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; APIs. The former returns a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and the latter one or one &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; values. The &lt;code&gt;ReadLine&lt;/code&gt; option is very similar to using &lt;code&gt;File.ReadLines&lt;/code&gt;, which is built on the same API. In the chart, I&amp;#8217;ve shown &lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;StreamReader.Read&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a lot more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="memory-its-best-to-read-a-page-at-a-time"&gt;Memory: It&amp;#8217;s best to read a page at a time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the speed differences, we&amp;#8217;re likely to see big memory differences, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/file-api-memory-large-document.png" title="Memory metrics for reading large document using .NET File I/O APIs" width="75%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s be char-itable. That&amp;#8217;s a dramatic difference. The low-level APIs have a fixed cost, while the memory requirements of the &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; APIs scale with the size of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FileOpenHandle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FileOpen&lt;/code&gt; benchmarks I wrote use &lt;code&gt;ArrayPool&lt;/code&gt; arrays, whose cost doesn&amp;#8217;t show up in the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;Encoding encoding = Encoding.UTF8;
Decoder decoder = encoding.GetDecoder();
// BenchmarkValues.Size = 4 * 1024
// charBufferSize = 4097
int charBufferSize = encoding.GetMaxCharCount(BenchmarkValues.Size);

char[] charBuffer = ArrayPool&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;.Shared.Rent(charBufferSize);
byte[] buffer = ArrayPool&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;.Shared.Rent(BenchmarkValues.Size);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code shows the two &lt;code&gt;ArrayPool&lt;/code&gt; arrays that are used (and their sizes). Based on observation, there is a significant performance benefit with a 4k buffer and limited (or none) past that. A 4k buffer seems reasonable to process a 600k file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have used private arrays (or accepted a buffer from the caller). My use of &lt;code&gt;ArrayPool&lt;/code&gt; arrays demonstrates the memory use difference in the underlying APIs. As you can see, the cost of &lt;code&gt;File.Open&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;File.OpenHandle&lt;/code&gt; is effectively zero (at least, relatively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, the memory use of my &lt;code&gt;FileOpen&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FileOpenHandle&lt;/code&gt; benchmarks would show up as very similar to &lt;code&gt;FileOpenText&lt;/code&gt; if I wasn&amp;#8217;t using &lt;code&gt;ArrayPool&lt;/code&gt;. That should give you the idea that &lt;code&gt;FileOpenText&lt;/code&gt; is pretty good (when not using &lt;code&gt;StreamReader.ReadLine&lt;/code&gt;). Certainly, my implementations could be updated to use much smaller buffers, but they would run slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="performance-parity-with-wc"&gt;Performance parity with &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve demonstrated that &lt;code&gt;System.IO&lt;/code&gt; can be used to produce the same results as &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;. I should similarly compare performance, using my best-performing benchmark. Here, I&amp;#8217;ll use the &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; command to record the entire invocation (process start to termination), processing both a single volume (of the novel) and all volumes. You&amp;#8217;ll see that the entirety of the novel (all 9 volumes) comprises &amp;gt;5MB of text and just shy of 1M words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s start with &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s no good! Wasn&amp;#8217;t even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s 70 and 124 milliseconds with .NET compared to 9 and 26 milliseconds with &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s really interesting that the duration doesn&amp;#8217;t scale with the size of the content, particularly with the .NET implementation. The runtime startup cost is clearly dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that a managed language runtime cannot keep up with native code on startup. The numbers validate that. If only we had a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; managed runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! We do. We have &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/"&gt;native AOT&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;#8217;s try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I enjoy using containers, I used one of our SDK container images (with volume mounting) to do the compilation so that I don&amp;#8217;t have &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net7%2Clinux-ubuntu#prerequisites"&gt;install a native toolchain&lt;/a&gt; on my machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking closely, you&amp;#8217;ll see the benchmark app compiles down to &amp;lt; 2MB (1_944_896) with native AOT. That&amp;#8217;s the runtime, libraries, and app code. Everything. In fact the symbols (&lt;code&gt;count.dbg&lt;/code&gt;) file is larger. I can take that executable to an Ubuntu 22.04 x64 machine, for example, and just run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s test native AOT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s 4 and 22 milliseconds with native AOT compared to 9 and 25 with &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;. Those are excellent results and quite competitive! The numbers are so good that I&amp;#8217;d almost have to double check, but the numbers validate the computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/optimizing#optimize-for-size-or-speed"&gt;configured the app&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;OptimizationPreference&amp;gt;Speed&amp;lt;/OptimizationPreference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It provided a small benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="text-runes-and-unicode"&gt;Text, Runes, and Unicode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is everywhere. In fact, you are reading it right now. .NET includes multiple types for processing and storing text, including &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.char"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Encoding&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.text.rune"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string"&gt;&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt; encodes over a million characters, including &lt;a href="https://home.unicode.org/emoji/about-emoji/"&gt;emoji&lt;/a&gt;. The first 128 characters of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII"&gt;ASCII&lt;/a&gt; and Unicode match. There are three &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Unicode_encodings"&gt;Unicode encodings&lt;/a&gt;: UTF8, UTF16, and UTF32, with varying numbers of bytes used to encode each character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s some (semi-relevant) text from The Hobbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Moon-letters are rune-letters, but you cannot see them,” said Elrond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot help but think that moon-letters are fantastic &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character"&gt;whitespace characters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of a &lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/tree/main/wordcount/codepoints"&gt;small utility&lt;/a&gt; that prints out information about each Unicode character, using that text.

&lt;p&gt;The opening &lt;a href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=201c&amp;amp;B1=Show"&gt;quotation mark&lt;/a&gt; character requires three bytes to encode. The remaining characters all require one byte since they are within the ASCII character range. We also see one whitespace character, the space character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binary representation of the characters that use the one-byte encoding exactly match their codepoint integer values. For example, the binary representation of codepoint &amp;#8220;M&amp;#8221; (77) is &lt;code&gt;0b01001101&lt;/code&gt;, the same as integer 77. In contrast, the binary representation of integer &lt;code&gt;8220&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0b_100000_00011100&lt;/code&gt;, not the three-byte binary value we see above for &lt;code&gt;“&lt;/code&gt;. That&amp;#8217;s because Unicode encodings &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5290182/how-many-bytes-does-one-unicode-character-take"&gt;describe more than just the codepoint value&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/tree/main/wordcount/printchars"&gt;another program&lt;/a&gt; that should provide even more insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;using System.Text;

char englishLetter = 'A';
char fancyQuote =  '“';
// char emoji = (char)0x1f600; // won't compile
string emoji = "\U0001f600";
Encoding encoding = Encoding.UTF8;

PrintChar(englishLetter);
PrintChar(fancyQuote);
PrintChar(emoji[0]);
PrintUnicodeCharacter(emoji);

void PrintChar(char c)
{
    int value = (int)c;
    // Rune rune = new Rune(c); // will throw since emoji[0] is an invalid rune
    Console.WriteLine($"{c}; bytes: {encoding.GetByteCount([c])}; integer value: {(int)c}; round-trip: {(char)value}");
}

void PrintUnicodeCharacter(string s)
{
    char[] chars = s.ToCharArray();
    int value = char.ConvertToUtf32(s, 0);
    Rune r1 = (Rune)value;
    Rune r2 = new Rune(chars[0], chars[1]);
    Console.WriteLine($"{s}; chars: {chars.Length}; bytes: {encoding.GetByteCount(chars)}; integer value: {value}; round-trip {char.ConvertFromUtf32(value)};");
    Console.WriteLine($"{s}; Runes match: {r1 == r2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; r1.Value == value}; {nameof(Rune.Utf8SequenceLength)}: {r1.Utf8SequenceLength}; {nameof(Rune.Utf16SequenceLength)}: {r1.Utf16SequenceLength}");
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It prints out the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;A; bytes: 1; integer value: 65; round-trip: A
“; bytes: 3; integer value: 8220; round-trip: “
�; bytes: 3; integer value: 55357; round-trip: �
&amp;#x1f600;; chars: 2; bytes: 4; integer value: 128512; round-trip &amp;#x1f600;;
&amp;#x1f600;; Runes match: True; Utf8SequenceLength: 4; Utf16SequenceLength: 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can run the app again, switching the encoding to UTF16. I switched the value of &lt;code&gt;encoding&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Encoding.Unicode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;A; bytes: 2; integer value: 65; round-trip: A
“; bytes: 2; integer value: 8220; round-trip: “
�; bytes: 2; integer value: 55357; round-trip: �
&amp;#x1f600;; chars: 2; bytes: 4; integer value: 128512; round-trip &amp;#x1f600;;
&amp;#x1f600;; Runes match: True; Utf8SequenceLength: 4; Utf16SequenceLength: 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That tells us a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UTF8 encoding has a non-uniform byte encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UTF16 encoding is more uniform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Characters that require a single codepoint can interoperate with &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, enabling patterns like &lt;code&gt;(char)8220&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(char)0x201C&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Characters that require two codepoints can be stored in a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, an (UTF32) integer value, or as a &lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt;, enabling patterns like &lt;code&gt;(Rune)128512&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is easy to write software with bugs if the code directly handles characters or (even worse) bytes. For example, imagine writing a text search algorithm that supports emoji search terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-codepoint characters are enough to rune any developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My terminal supports emoji (and I&amp;#8217;m very happy about that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can connect those Unicode concepts back to .NET types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; use the UTF16 encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Encoding&lt;/code&gt; classes enable processing text between the encodings and &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; supports Unicode characters that require one or two codepoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.text.rune#rune-in-net-vs-other-languages"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can represent all Unicode characters (including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set_characters#Surrogates"&gt;surrogate pairs&lt;/a&gt;), unlike &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these types are used in the benchmarks. All of the benchmarks (except one that cheats) properly use these types so that Unicode text is correctly processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s look at the benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="file-readlines-and-file-readalllines"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.ReadLines&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;File.ReadAllLines&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following benchmarks implement a high-level algorithm based on &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/wordcount/FileReadLinesBenchmark.cs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileReadLines&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/wordcount/FileReadAllLinesBenchmark.cs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileReadAllLinesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance charts in the results section include both of these benchmarks so there is no need to show these results again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FileReadLines&lt;/code&gt; benchmark sets the baseline for our analysis. It uses &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; over an &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public static Count Count(string path)
{
   long wordCount = 0, lineCount = 0, charCount = 0;

   foreach (string line in File.ReadLines(path))
   {
      lineCount++;
      charCount += line.Length;
      bool wasSpace = true;

      foreach (char c in line)
      {
            bool isSpace = char.IsWhiteSpace(c);

            if (!isSpace &amp;amp;&amp;amp; wasSpace)
            {
               wordCount++;
            }

            wasSpace = isSpace;
      }
   }

   return new(lineCount, wordCount, charCount, path);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code counts lines and character counts via the outer &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt;. The inner &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; counts words after spaces, looking at every character in the line. It uses &lt;code&gt;char.IsWhiteSpace&lt;/code&gt; to determine if a character is whitespace. This algorithm is about as simple as it gets for word counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;$ wc ../Clarissa_Harlowe/clarissa_volume1.txt
   11716  110023  610515 ../Clarissa_Harlowe/clarissa_volume1.txt

&lt;p&gt;Note: The app launches in the benchmarks in several different ways, for my own testing. That&amp;#8217;s the reason for the strange commandline arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results largely match the &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; tool. The byte counts don&amp;#8217;t match since this code works on characters not bytes. That means that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark"&gt;byte order marks&lt;/a&gt;, multi-byte encodings, and line termination characters have been hidden from view. I could have added +1 to the &lt;code&gt;charCount&lt;/code&gt; per line, but that didn&amp;#8217;t seem useful to me, particularly since there are multiple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline"&gt;newline schemes&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to accurately count characters or bytes and not attempt to approximate the differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: These APIs are great for small documents or when memory use isn&amp;#8217;t a strong constraint. I&amp;#8217;d only use &lt;code&gt;File.ReadAllLines&lt;/code&gt; if my algorithm relied on knowing the number of lines in a document up front and only for small documents. For larger documents, I&amp;#8217;d adopt a better algorithm to count line break characters to avoid using that API. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="file-opentext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following benchmarks implement a variety of approaches, all based on &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b6b00ec9f606eca0c47e01b30e74ee0d37d561ab/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO/File.cs#L30-L31"&gt;simply a wrapper around&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt; APIs expose &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; lines and others expose &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; values. This is where we&amp;#8217;re going to see a larger separation in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/wordcount/FileOpenTextReadLineBenchmark.cs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextReadLineBenchmark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/wordcount/FileOpenTextReadLineSearchValuesBenchmark.cs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextReadLineSearchValuesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/wordcount/FileOpenTextCharBenchmark.cs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharBenchmark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/wordcount/FileOpenTextCharLinesBenchmark.cs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharLinesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/wordcount/FileOpenTextCharIndexOfAnyBenchmark.cs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharIndexOfAnyBenchmark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/richlander/convenience/blob/wordcount/wordcount/wordcount/FileOpenTextCharSearchValuesBenchmark.cs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharSearchValuesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of these benchmarks is to determine the benefit of &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; and of &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;. I also included the &lt;code&gt;FileReadLinesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; benchmark as a baseline from the previous set of benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/11/file-open-text-speed-large-document.png" title="Speed metrics for reading large document using File.OpenText." width="75%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder about memory. The memory use with &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt; is a function of &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, which you can see in the initial memory charts earlier in the post. The differences in these algorithms affect speed, but not the memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextReadLineBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; benchmark is effectively identical to &lt;code&gt;FileReadLines&lt;/code&gt;, only without the &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; abstraction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextReadLineSearchValuesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; benchmark starts to get a bit more fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public static Count Count(string path)
{
   long wordCount = 0, lineCount = 0, charCount = 0;
   using StreamReader stream = File.OpenText(path);

   string? line = null;
   while ((line = stream.ReadLine()) is not null)
   {
      lineCount++;
      charCount += line.Length;
      ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; text = line.AsSpan().TrimStart();

      if (text.Length is 0)
      {
            continue;
      }

      int index = 0;
      while ((index = text.IndexOfAny(BenchmarkValues.WhitespaceSearchValuesNoLineBreak)) &amp;gt; 0)
      {
            wordCount++;
            text = text.Slice(index).TrimStart();
      }

      wordCount++;
   }

   return new(lineCount, wordCount, charCount, path);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This benchmark is simply counting spaces (that it doesn&amp;#8217;t trim). It is taking advantage of the new &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; type, which can speed up &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; when searching for more than just a few values. The &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; object is constructed with &lt;a href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=%5B:White_Space=Yes:%5D"&gt;whitespace characters&lt;/a&gt; except (most) line break characters. We can assume that line break characters are no longer present, since the code is relying on &lt;code&gt;StreamReader.ReadLine&lt;/code&gt; for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have used this same algorithm for the previous benchmark implementations, however, I wanted to match the most approachable APIs with the most approachable benchmark implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of the reason that &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; performs so well is vectorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;$ dotnet run -c Release 2
Vector64.IsHardwareAccelerated: False
Vector128.IsHardwareAccelerated: True
Vector256.IsHardwareAccelerated: True
Vector512.IsHardwareAccelerated: False&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET 8 includes vector APIs all the way up to 512 bits. You can use them in your own algorithms or rely on built-in APIs like &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; to take adantage of the improved processing power. The handy &lt;code&gt;IsHardwareAccelerated&lt;/code&gt; API tells you how large the vector registers are on a given CPU. This is the result on my Intel machine. I experimented with some newer Intel hardware available in Azure, which reported  &lt;code&gt;Vector512.IsHardwareAccelerated&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;. My MacBook M1 machine reports as &lt;code&gt;Vector128.IsHardwareAccelerated&lt;/code&gt; as the highest available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now leave the land of &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and switch to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; values. There are two expected big benefits. The first is that the underlying API doesn&amp;#8217;t need to read ahead to find a line break character and there won&amp;#8217;t be any more strings to heap allocate and garbage collect. We should see a marked improvement in speed and we already know from previous charts that there is a significant reduction in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I constructed the following benchmarks to tease apart the value of various strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#8212; Same basic algorithm as &lt;code&gt;FileReadLines&lt;/code&gt; with the addition of a check for line breaks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharLinesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#8212; An attempt to simplify the core algorithm by synthesizing lines of chars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharSearchValuesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#8212; Similar use of &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextReadLineSearchValuesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; to speed up the space searching, but without pre-computed lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharIndexOfAnyBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#8212; Exact same algorithm but uses &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of the new &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These benchmarks (as demonstrated in the chart above) tell us that &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is very beneficial. It&amp;#8217;s interesting to see how poorly &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; does when given so many values (25) to check. It&amp;#8217;s a lot slower than simply interating over every character with a &lt;code&gt;char.IsWhiteSpace&lt;/code&gt; check. These results should give you pause if you are using a large set of search terms with &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some testing on some other machines. I noticed that &lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharLinesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; performed quite well on an AVX512 machine (with a lower clock speed). That&amp;#8217;s possibly because it is relying more heavily on &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; (with only two search terms) and is otherwise a pretty lean algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the &lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharSearchValuesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public static Count Count(string path)
{
   long wordCount = 0, lineCount = 0, charCount = 0;
   bool wasSpace = true;

   char[] buffer = ArrayPool&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;.Shared.Rent(BenchmarkValues.Size);
   using StreamReader reader = File.OpenText(path);

   int count = 0;
   while ((count = reader.Read(buffer)) &amp;gt; 0)
   {
      charCount += count;
      Span&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; chars = buffer.AsSpan(0, count);

      while (chars.Length &amp;gt; 0)
      {
            if (char.IsWhiteSpace(chars[0]))
            {
               if (chars[0] is '\n')
               {
                  lineCount++;                      
               }

               wasSpace = true;
               chars = chars.Slice(1);
               continue;
            }
            else if (wasSpace)
            {
               wordCount++;
               wasSpace = false;
               chars = chars.Slice(1);
            }

            int index = chars.IndexOfAny(BenchmarkValues.WhitespaceSearchValues);

            if (index &amp;gt; -1)
            {
               if (chars[index] is '\n')
               {
                  lineCount++;       
               }

               wasSpace = true;
               chars = chars.Slice(index + 1);
            }
            else
            {
               wasSpace = false;
               chars = [];
            }
      }
   }

   ArrayPool&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;.Shared.Return(buffer);
   return new(lineCount, wordCount, charCount, path);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#8217;t that different to the original implementation. The first block needs to account for line breaks within the &lt;code&gt;char.IsWhiteSpace&lt;/code&gt; check. After that, &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; is used with a &lt;code&gt;SearchValue&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to find the next whitespace character so that the next check can be done. If &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;, we know that there are no more whitespace characters so there is no need to read any further into the buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used pervasively in this implementation. Spans provide a cheap way of creating window on an underlying array. They are so cheap that its fine for the implementation to continue slicing all the way to when &lt;code&gt;chars.Length &amp;gt; 0&lt;/code&gt; is no longer true. I only used that approach with algorithms that required slices &amp;gt;1 characters at once. Otherwise, I used a for loop to iterate over a &lt;code&gt;Span&lt;/code&gt;, which was faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Visual Studio will suggest that &lt;code&gt;chars.Slice(1)&lt;/code&gt; can be simplified to &lt;code&gt;chars[1..]&lt;/code&gt;. I discovered that the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47629"&gt;simplication isn&amp;#8217;t equivalent&lt;/a&gt; and shows up as a performance regression in benchmarks. It&amp;#8217;s much less likely to be a problem in apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextChar*&lt;/code&gt; benchmarks are a lot closer to matching &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; for the byte results (for ASCII text). The Byte Order Mark (BOM) is consumed before these APIs start returning values. As a result, the byte counts for the the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; returning APIs are consistently off by three bytes (the size of the BOM). Unlike the &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; returning APIs, all of the line break characters are counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt; (which is the basis of &lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt;) offers a flexible set of APIs covering a broad range of approachability and performance. For most use cases (if &lt;code&gt;File.ReadLines&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t appropriate), &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt; is a great default choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="file-open-and-file-openhandle"&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.Open&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;File.OpenHandle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following benchmarks implement the lowest-level algorithms, based on bytes. &lt;code&gt;File.Open&lt;/code&gt; is wrapper on &lt;code&gt;FileStream&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;File.OpenHandle&lt;/code&gt; returns an operating system handle, which requires &lt;code&gt;RandomAccess.Read&lt;/code&gt; to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These APIs offer a lot more control. Lines and chars are now gone and we&amp;#8217;re left with bytes. The goal of these benchmarks is to get the best performance possible and to explore the facilities for correctly reading Unicode text given that the APIs return bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last attempt to match the results of &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The byte counts now match. We&amp;#8217;re now looking at every byte in a given file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FileOpenHandleCharSearchValuesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; adds some new concepts. &lt;code&gt;FileOpenCharSearchValuesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; is effectively identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public static Count Count(string path)
{
   long wordCount = 0, lineCount = 0, byteCount = 0;
   bool wasSpace = true;

   Encoding encoding = Encoding.UTF8;
   Decoder decoder = encoding.GetDecoder();
   int charBufferSize = encoding.GetMaxCharCount(BenchmarkValues.Size);

   char[] charBuffer = ArrayPool&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;.Shared.Rent(charBufferSize);
   byte[] buffer = ArrayPool&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;.Shared.Rent(BenchmarkValues.Size);
   using Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeFileHandle handle = File.OpenHandle(path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read, FileOptions.SequentialScan);

   // Read content in chunks, in buffer, at count lenght, starting at byteCount
   int count = 0;
   while ((count = RandomAccess.Read(handle, buffer, byteCount)) &amp;gt; 0)
   {
      byteCount += count;
      int charCount = decoder.GetChars(buffer.AsSpan(0, count), charBuffer, false);
      ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; chars = charBuffer.AsSpan(0, charCount);

      while (chars.Length &amp;gt; 0)
      {
            if (char.IsWhiteSpace(chars[0]))
            {
               if (chars[0] is '\n')
               {
                  lineCount++;                      
               }

               wasSpace = true;
               chars = chars.Slice(1);
               continue;
            }
            else if (wasSpace)
            {
               wordCount++;
               wasSpace = false;
               chars = chars.Slice(1);
            }

            int index = chars.IndexOfAny(BenchmarkValues.WhitespaceSearchValues);

            if (index &amp;gt; -1)
            {
               if (chars[index] is '\n')
               {
                  lineCount++;       
               }

               wasSpace = true;
               chars = chars.Slice(index + 1);
            }
            else
            {
               wasSpace = false;
               chars = [];
            }
      }
   }

   ArrayPool&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;.Shared.Return(charBuffer);
   ArrayPool&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;.Shared.Return(buffer);
   return new(lineCount, wordCount, byteCount, path);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of this algorithm is effectively identical to &lt;code&gt;FileOpenTextCharSearchValuesBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; implementation we just saw. What&amp;#8217;s different is the initial setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following two blocks of code are new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;Encoding encoding = Encoding.UTF8;
Decoder decoder = encoding.GetDecoder();
int charBufferSize = encoding.GetMaxCharCount(BenchmarkValues.Size);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code gets a UTF8 decoder for converting bytes to chars. It also gets the maximum number of characters that the decoder might produce given the size of byte buffer that will be used. This implementation is hard-coded to use UTF8. It could be made dynamic (by reading the byte order mark) to use another Unicode encodings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;int charCount = decoder.GetChars(buffer.AsSpan(0, count), charBuffer, false);
ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; chars = charBuffer.AsSpan(0, charCount);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This block decodes the buffer of bytes into the character buffer. Both buffers are correctly sized (with &lt;code&gt;AsSpan&lt;/code&gt;) per the reported &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; count values. After that, the code adopts a more familiar &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;-based algorithm. There is no obvious way to use &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that plays nicely with the multi-byte Unicode encodings. This approach works fine, so that doesn&amp;#8217;t matter much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about convenience. I found &lt;code&gt;Decoder.GetChars&lt;/code&gt; to be incredibly convenient. it&amp;#8217;s a perfect example of a low-level API that does exactly what is needed and sort of saves the day down in the trenches. I found this pattern by reading how &lt;code&gt;File.ReadLines&lt;/code&gt; (indirectly) solves this same problem. &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/main/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/IO"&gt;All that code&lt;/a&gt; is there to be read. It&amp;#8217;s open source!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOpenHandleRuneBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt; class instead of &lt;code&gt;Encoding&lt;/code&gt;. It turns out to be slower, in part because I returned to a more basic algorithm. It wasn&amp;#8217;t obvious how to use &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt;, in part because there is no analog to &lt;code&gt;decoder.GetChars&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public static Count Count(string path)
{
   long wordCount = 0, lineCount = 0, byteCount = 0;
   bool wasSpace = true;

   byte[] buffer = ArrayPool&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;.Shared.Rent(BenchmarkValues.Size);
   using Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeFileHandle handle = File.OpenHandle(path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read, FileOptions.SequentialScan);
   int index = 0;

   // Read content in chunks, in buffer, at count lenght, starting at byteCount
   int count = 0;
   while ((count = RandomAccess.Read(handle, buffer.AsSpan(index), byteCount)) &amp;gt; 0 || index &amp;gt; 0)
   {
      byteCount += count;
      Span&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt; bytes = buffer.AsSpan(0, count + index);
      index = 0;

      while (bytes.Length &amp;gt; 0)
      {
            OperationStatus status = Rune.DecodeFromUtf8(bytes, out Rune rune, out int bytesConsumed);

            // bad read due to low buffer length
            if (status == OperationStatus.NeedMoreData &amp;amp;&amp;amp; count &amp;gt; 0)
            {
               bytes[..bytesConsumed].CopyTo(buffer); // move the partial Rune to the start of the buffer before next read
               index = bytesConsumed;
               break;
            }

            if (Rune.IsWhiteSpace(rune))
            {
               if (rune.Value is '\n')
               {
                  lineCount++;
               }

               wasSpace = true;
            }
            else if (wasSpace)
            {
               wordCount++;
               wasSpace = false;
            }

            bytes = bytes.Slice(bytesConsumed);
      }
   }

   ArrayPool&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;.Shared.Return(buffer);
   return new(lineCount, wordCount, byteCount, path);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t a lot different here and that&amp;#8217;s a good thing. &lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt; is largely a drop-in replacement for &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line is the key difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;var status = Rune.DecodeFromUtf8(bytes, out Rune rune, out int bytesConsumed);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted an API that returns a Unicode character from a &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and reports how many bytes were read. It could be 1 to 4 bytes. &lt;code&gt;Rune.DecodeFromUtf8&lt;/code&gt; does precisely that. For my purposes, I don&amp;#8217;t care if I get a &lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; back. They are both structs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left &lt;code&gt;FileOpenHandleAsciiCheatBenchmark&lt;/code&gt; for last. I wanted to see how much faster the code could be made to run if it could apply the maxiumum number of assumptions. In short, what would an ASCII-only algorithm look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public static Count Count(string path)
{
   const byte NEWLINE = (byte)'\n';
   const byte SPACE = (byte)' ';
   ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt; searchValues = [SPACE, NEWLINE];

   long wordCount = 0, lineCount = 0, byteCount = 0;
   bool wasSpace = true;

   byte[] buffer = ArrayPool&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;.Shared.Rent(BenchmarkValues.Size);
   using Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeFileHandle handle = File.OpenHandle(path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read, FileOptions.SequentialScan);

   // Read content in chunks, in buffer, at count lenght, starting at byteCount
   int count = 0;
   while ((count = RandomAccess.Read(handle, buffer, byteCount)) &amp;gt; 0)
   {
      byteCount += count;
      Span&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt; bytes = buffer.AsSpan(0, count);

      while (bytes.Length &amp;gt; 0)
      {
            // what's this character?
            if (bytes[0] &amp;lt;= SPACE)
            {
               if (bytes[0] is NEWLINE)
               {
                  lineCount++;
               }

               wasSpace = true;
               bytes = bytes.Slice(1);
               continue;
            }
            else if (wasSpace)
            {
               wordCount++;
            }

            // Look ahead for next space or newline
            // this logic assumes that preceding char was non-whitespace
            int index = bytes.IndexOfAny(searchValues);

            if (index &amp;gt; -1)
            {
               if (bytes[index] is NEWLINE)
               {
                  lineCount++;
               }

               wasSpace = true;
               bytes = bytes.Slice(index + 1);
            }
            else
            {
               wasSpace = false;
               bytes = [];
            }
      }
   }

   ArrayPool&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;.Shared.Return(buffer);
   return new(lineCount, wordCount, byteCount, path);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code is nearly identical to what you&amp;#8217;ve seen before except it searches for far fewer characters, which &amp;#8212; SURPRISE &amp;#8212; speeds up the algorithm. You can see that in the chart earlier in this section. &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t used here since it&amp;#8217;s not optimized for only two values.&lt;/p&gt;

11716 110023 610515 /Users/rich/git/convenience/wordcount/wordcount/bin/Release/net8.0/Clarissa_Harlowe/clarissa_volume1.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm is still able to produce the expected results. That&amp;#8217;s only because the text file satisfies the assumption of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: &lt;code&gt;File.Open&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;File.OpenHandle&lt;/code&gt; offer the highest control and performance. In the case of text data, it&amp;#8217;s not obvious that it is worth the extra effort over &lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt; (with &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;) even though they can deliver higher performance. In this case, these APIs were required to match the byte count baseline. For non-text data, these APIs are a more obvious choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.IO&lt;/code&gt; provides effective APIs that cover many use cases. I like how easy it is to create straightforward algorithms with &lt;code&gt;File.ReadLines&lt;/code&gt;. It works very well for content that is line-based. &lt;code&gt;File.OpenText&lt;/code&gt; enables writing faster algorithms without a big step in complexity. Last, &lt;code&gt;File.Open&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;File.OpenHandle&lt;/code&gt; are great for getting access to the binary content of files and to enable writing the most high-performance and accurate algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t set out to explore .NET globalization APIs or Unicode in quite so much depth. I&amp;#8217;d used the encoding APIs before, but never tried &lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt;. I was impressed to see how well those APIs suited my project and how well they were able to perform. These APIs were a surprise case-in-point example of the convenience premise of the post. Convenience doesn&amp;#8217;t mean &amp;#8220;high-level&amp;#8221;, but &amp;#8220;right and approachable tool for the job&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another insight was that for this problem, the high-level APIs were approachable and effective, however, only the low-level APIs were up to the task of exactly matching the results of &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;. I didn&amp;#8217;t understand that dynamic when I started the project, however, I was happy that the required APIs were well within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/GrabYourPitchforks"&gt;Levi Broderick&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing the benchmarks and helping me understand the finer points of Unicode a little better.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文介绍了AWS的一些重点发布，包括Amazon EC2的Capacity Blocks、Finch、AWS X-Ray、Amazon Translate brevity customization以及AWS IAM的增强。此外，还提到了其他一些AWS的新闻和博客文章，并介绍了即将到来的AWS活动，其中包括AWS re:Invent大会。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The year is coming to an end, and there are only 50 days until Christmas and 21 days to AWS &lt;a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;re:Invent&lt;/a&gt;! If you are in Las Vegas, come and say hi&amp;nbsp;to me. I will be around the Serverlesspresso booth most of the time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last week’s launches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon EC2 – &lt;/strong&gt;Amazon EC2 announced Capacity Blocks for ML. This means that you can now reserve GPU compute capacity for your short-duration ML workloads. Learn more about this launch on the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/capacityblocks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;feature page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-amazon-ec2-capacity-blocks-for-ml-to-reserve-gpu-capacity-for-your-machine-learning-workloads/"&gt;announcement blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/11/06/image01-4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-77407" height="640" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/11/06/image01-4.png" width="932" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finch – &lt;/strong&gt;Finch is now generally available. Finch is an open source tool for local container development on macOS (using Intel or Apple Silicon). It provides a command line developer tool for building, running, and publishing Linux containers on macOS. Learn more about Finch in &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/ready-for-flight-announcing-finch-1-0-ga/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this blog post written by Phil Estes&lt;/a&gt; or on the &lt;a href="https://runfinch.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Finch&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS X-Ray – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/aws-x-ray-w3c-format-trace-ids-distributed-tracing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AWS X-Ray now supports W3C format trace IDs for distributed tracing&lt;/a&gt;. AWS X-Ray supports trace IDs generated through OpenTelemetry or any other framework that conforms to the W3C Trace Context specification.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Translate&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;– &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/11/amazon-translate-brevity-translation-output-lengths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Translate introduces a brevity customization to reduce translation output length&lt;/a&gt;. This is a new feature that you can enable in your real-time translations where you need a shorter translation to meet caption size limits. This translation is not literal, but it will preserve the underlying message.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS IAM&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;– &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/11/aws-iam-action-accessed-information-60-services/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IAM increased the &lt;em&gt;actions last accessed&lt;/em&gt; to 60 more services&lt;/a&gt;. This functionality is very useful when fine-tuning the permissions of the roles, identifying unused permissions, and granting the least amount of permissions that your roles need.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS IAM Access Analyzer&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/11/iam-access-analyzer-policy-generation-coverage-over-200-aws-services/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IAM Access Analyzer policy generator expanded support to identify over 200 AWS services&lt;/a&gt; to help you create fine-grained policies based on your AWS CloudTrail access activity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/new/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;What’s New at AWS page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other AWS news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some other news and blog posts that you may have missed:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Compute Blog&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/sending-and-receiving-webhooks-on-aws-innovate-with-event-notifications/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Wirjo and Justin Plock wrote a very interesting article&lt;/a&gt; about how you can send and receive webhooks on AWS using different AWS serverless services. This is a good read if you are working with webhooks on your application, as it not only shows you how to build these solutions but also what considerations you should have when building them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/11/06/image02-3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-77408" height="1004" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/11/06/image02-3.png" width="1738" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Storage Blog&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;– &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/manage-event-ordering-and-duplicate-events-with-amazon-s3-event-notifications/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bimal Gajjar and Andrew Peace wrote a very useful blog post&lt;/a&gt; about how to handle event ordering and duplicate events with Amazon S3 Event Notifications. This is a common challenge for many customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Science Blog&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/better-foundation-models-for-video-representation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;David Fan wrote an article&lt;/a&gt; about how to build better foundation models for video representation. This article is based on a paper that Prime Video presented at a conference about this topic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/podcasts/aws-podcast/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Official AWS Podcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Listen each week for updates on the latest AWS news and deep dives into exciting use cases.

      <title>Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service IMDSv2 by default</title>
      <link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-instance-metadata-service-imdsv2-by-default/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2 instance types&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMDSv1 and IMDSv2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migration plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools for transitioning to IMDSv2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;背景&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EC2 Instance Metadata Service（IMDS）可从EC2实例内部访问，提供静态和动态数据。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMDS的版本分为v1和v2，v2提供更高级的保护。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;迁移计划&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019年11月推出IMDSv2，并演示如何使用它来增加深度防御。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020年2月开始验证AWS Marketplace和AWS合作伙伴的新产品是否支持IMDSv2。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023年3月推出Amazon Linux 2023，默认使用IMDSv2。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023年9月发布博文，展示如何在AWS基础设施上充分利用IMDSv2并禁用IMDSv1。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023年11月起，所有控制台快速启动将仅使用IMDSv2。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024年2月计划引入新的API功能，允许在账户级别控制IMDSv1的使用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024年中期，新发布的Amazon EC2实例类型将默认使用IMDSv2。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;迁移方法&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;参考博文和工具进行从IMDSv1到IMDSv2的迁移。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;设置IAM策略禁用IMDSv1。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;使用CloudWatch指标监测剩余的IMDSv1使用情况。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可以使用Systems Manager automation来强制使用IMDSv2访问实例元数据。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;补充资源&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在AWS re:Post上获取有关使用Systems Manager自动化实施IMDSv2访问的指南。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如需帮助，请联系AWS Support。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文章介绍了Amazon EC2实例中的EC2 Instance Metadata Service（IMDS）及其版本IMDSv1和IMDSv2。IMDSv2提供了更高级的安全保护，并逐渐成为新AWS基础架构的默认选择。迁移计划涵盖了IMDSv2的发布时间和推广方式，并提供了工具和方法来帮助迁移。为了实现平稳过渡，AWS推出了支持IMDSv1和IMDSv2的实例类型，并提供详细的迁移指南和资源。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Effective mid-2024, newly released Amazon EC2 instance types will use only version 2 of the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html"&gt;EC2 Instance Metadata Service&lt;/a&gt; (IMDSv2). We are also taking a series of steps to make IMDSv2 the default choice for AWS Management Console Quick Starts and other launch pathways.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This service is accessible from within an EC2 instance at a fixed IP address (&lt;strong&gt;169.254.169.254&lt;/strong&gt; via IPv4 or &lt;strong&gt;fd00:ec2::254&lt;/strong&gt; via IPv6 on Nitro instances). It gives you (or the code running on the instance) access to a wealth of static and dynamic data including the ID of the AMI that was used to launch the instance, block device mappings, temporary IAM credentials for roles that are attached to the instance, network interface information, user data, and much more, as detailed in &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html"&gt;Instance Metadata Categories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The v1 service uses a request/response access method and the v2 service uses a session-oriented method, as detailed in &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Both services are fully secure, but v2 provides additional layers of protection for four types of vulnerabilities that could be used to try to access IMDS.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many applications and instances are already using and benefiting from IMDSv2, but the full range of benefits become available only when IMDSv1 is disabled at the AWS account level.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migration Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here are the significant steps that we have taken, and those that plan to take, on the road to making IMDSv2 the default choice for new AWS infrastructure (allow a tiny bit of wiggle room on the 2023 and 2024 dates):&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2019&lt;/strong&gt; – We &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/"&gt;launched IMDSv2&lt;/a&gt; and showed you how to use it to add defense in depth.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2020&lt;/strong&gt; – We began to verify that all newly published products from AWS Marketplace sellers and AWS Partners support IMDSv2.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 2023&lt;/strong&gt; – We launched &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2023/"&gt;Amazon Linux 2023&lt;/a&gt;, which uses IMDSv2 by default for all launches.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2023&lt;/strong&gt; – We published a blog post to show you how to &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/get-the-full-benefits-of-imdsv2-and-disable-imdsv1-across-your-aws-infrastructure/"&gt;Get the full benefits of IMDSv2 and disable IMDSv1 across your AWS infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2023&lt;/strong&gt; – Starting today, all console Quick Start launches will use IMDSv2-only (all Amazon and Partner Quick Start AMIs support this). Here’s how this is specified in the EC2 Console within &lt;strong&gt;Advanced details&lt;/strong&gt; when launching an instance:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75854" height="374" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/11/imds_template_v1.png" width="623" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2024&lt;/strong&gt; – We plan to introduce a new API function that will allow you to control the use of IMDSv1 as the default at the account level. You can already control IMDSv1 usage in an IAM policy (taking away and limiting existing permission), or as an SCP that is applied globally across an account, an organizational unit (OU), or an entire organization. For example IAM policies read &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ExamplePolicies_EC2.html#iam-example-instance-metadata"&gt;Work with instance metadata&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-2024&lt;/strong&gt; – Newly released Amazon EC2 instance types will use IMDSv2 only by default. For transition support, you will still be able to enable/turn on IMDSv1 at launch or after launch on an instance live without the need for a restart or stop/start.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now is the time to get started on your migration from IMDSv1 to IMDSv2 using the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/get-the-full-benefits-of-imdsv2-and-disable-imdsv1-across-your-aws-infrastructure/"&gt;Get the full benefits..&lt;/a&gt; blog post as a guide. You should also become familiar with the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-metadata-transition-to-version-2.html"&gt;Tools for helping with the transition to IMDSv2&lt;/a&gt;, along with the recommended path on the same page. In addition to recommending tools, this page shows you how to set up an IAM policy that disables the use of IMDSv1 and shows you how to use the &lt;code&gt;MetadataNoToken&lt;/code&gt; CloudWatch metric to detect any remaining usage:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75865" height="350" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/11/imds_cw_no_token_1.png" width="514" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want this transition to be as smooth as possible for you and for your customers. If you need any additional help, please contact &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/"&gt;AWS Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Meta built Threads in 5 months</title>
      <link>https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/06/android/how-meta-built-threads-in-5-months/</link>
      <description>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In about five short months, a small team of engineers at Meta took Threads, the new text-based conversations app, from from an idea to the most successful app launch of all time, pulling in over 100M users in its first five days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But this achievement wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been possible without Meta&amp;#8217;s existing systems and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On the latest episode of the &lt;a href="https://insidefacebookmobile.libsyn.com/55-what-its-like-to-ship-code-at-meta" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Meta Tech Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, Meta engineer Pascal Hartig (&lt;a href="https://www.threads.net/@passy_" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;@passy&lt;/a&gt;) is joined by &lt;span class="xt0psk2"&gt;Joy Qiu&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="xt0psk2"&gt;Cameron Roth,&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xt0psk2"&gt;Richard Zadorozny, &lt;/span&gt;three engineers from the Threads team, who worked on backend, iOS, and Android respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文讨论了组织在工作流程中集成观测性平台的重要性，并介绍了HCP Vault的核心集成以及与新的观测性SaaS提供商的集成。文章还提到了HCP Vault提供的日志和指标流式传输功能，以及如何利用这些功能进行安全操作和管理决策。通过示例和指标，读者可以了解如何使用HCP Vault来识别可疑使用模式、进行容量规划和优化成本。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The importance of organizations integrating observability platforms into their workflows continues to be a critical step in building and maintaining a strong “security-first,” posture. Observability platforms give organizations greater flexibility when streaming their &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/audit"&gt;audit logs&lt;/a&gt; and performance metrics into automated threat detection and incident response workflows.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault"&gt;HCP Vault&lt;/a&gt; offered &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hcp-vault-adds-3-new-observability-integrations"&gt;three industry-standard core integrations&lt;/a&gt; with top-tier observability platforms: Datadog, Grafana Cloud, and Splunk. A few use cases that users have opted for with these platforms include identification of suspicious user activity, capacity planning, and cost optimization in order to reduce client count. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HCP Vault will now allow users to directly integrate their production-grade clusters with three new top tier observability SaaS providers which include: Amazon Cloudwatch, Elasticsearch, and New Relic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, HCP Vault will now be providing a feature for administrators and contributors to set up audit logs and metrics streaming via HTTP. This will allow users who do not have a supported dashboard/integration through an observability provider to proceed with setting up log/metrics streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Audit" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1699287621-auditlog-streaming-integrations-edited.png" /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HCP Vault and observability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HCP Vault compiles audit log data and performance metrics from your HCP Vault cluster to provide users with both security and operational insights that can help better inform management decisions. Performance metrics provide an opportunity for users to optimize client usage patterns to better manage and reduce costs. Additional metrics provide insights that allow users to identify suspicious usage patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance metrics are scoped to best practice, user-actionable information in a managed service context. See the &lt;a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/cloud/vault-metrics-guide"&gt;HCP Vault Metrics Guide&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of exported metrics and how to use them. For instructions on configuring metrics streaming to your existing external SIEMs, see the &lt;a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/cloud-monitoring"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sample use cases and metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These turnkey log and metrics integrations allow customers to enhance security operations, plan for sufficient infrastructure capacity, and identify opportunities to optimize usage patterns for cost savings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identification of suspicious usage patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; By tracking steady-state usage patterns and watching for anomalies like tokens with unexpectedly long time-to-live (TTL), unexplained spikes in new admin tokens, or unusual policy creation behaviors, security issues can be quickly identified, investigated, and remediated. These same metrics and events will help security teams identify opportunities to harden internal security practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity planning:&lt;/strong&gt; Latency metrics for key Vault operations, like token revoke and renew latencies, as well as the comparison of Vault usage trends to host performance metrics can inform whether the cluster needs to be resized to meet anticipated demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost optimization:&lt;/strong&gt; Client count can impact cost. Identifying the infrastructure and organizational sources of tokens can help drive client reduction efforts, for example through the use of &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/auth-methods/identity"&gt;entity aliases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with HCP Vault observability&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Why doesn’t reduction by modulo work for floating point values?</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231106-00/?p=108971</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词&lt;/strong&gt;: modulo operation, floating point values, integer modulo technique, ring homomorphism, division&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;模运算在整数上有效，但在浮点数上却不起作用&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整数模运算技巧的原理是基于整数加法和乘法的结果仍然是整数&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;浮点数的模运算结果不保证是整数，因此无法利用该技巧&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;模运算在整数环中是一个环同态映射，但在除法运算上并不适用&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;数学上，模运算是整数环到模环的映射&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文讨论了为什么模运算在浮点数上失效。模运算在整数上有效是因为整数加法和乘法的结果仍然是整数，但浮点数的加法和乘法运算结果不保证是整数。因此，无法利用整数模运算技巧来处理浮点数。模运算是一个环同态映射，但在除法运算上并不适用。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is commonly known that if you want to perform a calculation modulo an integer, you can apply the modulo operation at each step of the calculation, instead of carrying a huge value and then reducing it at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;uint32_t MultiplyMod10(uint32_t a, uint32_t b)
{
    // Naïve version: Overflow danger
    return (a * b) % 10;

    // Reduce modulo 10 after each step.
    return ((a % 10) * (b % 10)) % 10;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this trick doesn&amp;#8217;t work for floating point values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;constexpr double TwoPi = 6.2831853071795864769252867665590058L;

double MultiplyModulo2Pi(double a, double b)
{
    // Naïve version gives correct answer
    return fmod(a * b, TwoPi);

    // But this gives the wrong answer
    return fmod(fmod(a, TwoPi) * fmod(b, TwoPi), TwoPi);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, trying to calculate 7.5 × 10 mod 2&lt;var&gt;π&lt;/var&gt; using the naïve formula gives the correct value of 75 mod 2&lt;var&gt;π&lt;/var&gt; ≈ 5.8850. But using the alternate formula gives the incorrect value of (1.2168 × 3.7168) mod 2&lt;var&gt;π&lt;/var&gt; ≈ 4.5227.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simpler demonstration of this problem is calculating (½ × 2) mod 2. The naïve version gives you the correct 1 mod 2 = 1. The flawed incorrect version gives you (½ mod 2) (2 mod 2) mod 2 = (½ × 0) mod 2 = 0 mod 2 = 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s going on? Is math broken?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math is not broken. Your expectations are broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s see why the integer modulo technique works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt; mod &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt; means that &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt; + &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; for some integer &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt; mod &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) (&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt; mod &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) =&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₁ + &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) (&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₂ + &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) =&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₂ + &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; + &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; + &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;² =&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₂ + (&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₂ + &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₁ + &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;)&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; =&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₂ + &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₃&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;, where &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₃ = &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₂ + &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₁ + &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;, and &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; are all integers, then so too will be &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₂ + &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₁ + &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₁&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₂&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;, and the final expression shows that then (&lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt; mod &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) (&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt; mod &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) mod &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt; mod &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;, and &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; are not all integers, then that expression for &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;₃ might not end up being an integer, and then the conclusion breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, taking the modulus after each operation works with integers because the trick relies on the fact that adding and multiplying integers produces another integer. Once you throw floating point values into the formula, the end result is not guaranteed to be an integer any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus chatter&lt;/b&gt;: Mathematically, the modulus operation is a ring homomorphism from the ring of integers to the ring of integers modulo &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;. Ring operations are addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Note that the trick doesn&amp;#8217;t work with division: (2 ÷ 2) mod 2 = 1 mod 2 = 1, but ((2 mod 2) ÷ (2 mod 2)) mod 2 = (0 ÷ 0) mod 2 = nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文首先介绍了Python 3.12的发布，讨论了升级项目时可能遇到的挑战以及核心库的兼容性。然后，文章概述了Python的新发展，包括Python 3.13的预告、功能变化和移除，以及Python开发和维护的平台和核心开发者的讨论和工作。最后，提到了Steering Council正在接受提名。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 2023 saw the release of the new &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.12&lt;/strong&gt;. At the same time, focus has shifted to new developments in the language. The acceptance of the long-discussed &lt;strong&gt;PEP 703&lt;/strong&gt; means that developers can ramp up their work on a free-threading version of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steering council does an important job governing Python and its development. Nominations for the next steering council are now open. Currently, groups are being established that’ll support the steering council by specifically focusing on &lt;strong&gt;typing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;documentation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="python-312-released"&gt;Python 3.12 Released&lt;a class="headerlink" href="https://realpython.com/atom.xml#python-312-released" title="Permanent link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest version of Python, &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python312-new-features/"&gt;Python 3.12&lt;/a&gt;, came out on October 2. You can read more about the release in &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-news-september-2023/#python-312-arrives-in-october-2023"&gt;last month’s newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t tried Python 3.12 for yourself yet, then you should give it a quick spin! Especially if you’re working on a library or an application, it’s good to check that it works on the latest version of Python. You can &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/installing-python/"&gt;install&lt;/a&gt; several versions of Python on your computer to try them side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge with upgrading a project to a brand-new version of Python is that some of your dependencies may &lt;a href="https://pyreadiness.org/3.12/"&gt;not be ready&lt;/a&gt; yet. In general, pure Python libraries should continue to work well, while you may experience issues with extension modules that need to be compiled especially for Python 3.12. However, most of the popular libraries are on the ball and are providing compatible &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-wheels/"&gt;wheels&lt;/a&gt; already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="python-enjoys-new-developments"&gt;Python Enjoys New Developments&lt;a class="headerlink" href="https://realpython.com/atom.xml#python-enjoys-new-developments" title="Permanent link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Python 3.12 has just been released, the core developers have been working on Python 3.13 for several months already. You can expect the next version of Python to be &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0719/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130a1/"&gt;first alpha version of Python 3.13&lt;/a&gt; is now available. As it’s still early in development, you won’t find many &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html"&gt;new features&lt;/a&gt; yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the main differences between Python 3.12 and 3.13 so far are &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#deprecated"&gt;deprecations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#removed"&gt;removals&lt;/a&gt; of old functionality. In particular, the &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python311-new-features/#dead-batteries"&gt;dead batteries&lt;/a&gt; identified in Python 3.11 have now been removed, and many private functions in Python’s C API have been &lt;a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/c-api-my-plan-to-clarify-private-vs-public-functions-in-python-3-13/30131"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several places where you can follow the discussions and work that goes into developing and maintaining Python, including GitHub, discussion forums, and &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org/"&gt;PEP&lt;/a&gt; documents. Last month, core developers &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/130/"&gt;Pablo Galindo Salgado&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/82/"&gt;Łukasz Langa&lt;/a&gt; unveiled a new platform for Python news: a podcast named &lt;a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/corepy"&gt;core.py&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2BvTXdt0IP9XG6pjiopR2K"&gt;first episode&lt;/a&gt;, Pablo and Łukasz discuss some of the features that are in development for Python 3.13. These include an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pyblogsal/status/1715473916536234441"&gt;improved editing experience&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-repl/"&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/tree/main/3.13"&gt;Faster CPython&lt;/a&gt; project’s just-in-time (JIT) compiler prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6K9BLLnjuYQZAeejeseY3c"&gt;second episode&lt;/a&gt;, they cover PEP 703 and the road toward a version of Python without the &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-gil/"&gt;GIL&lt;/a&gt;. The GIL—or global interpreter lock—is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)"&gt;mutex&lt;/a&gt; that ensures that only one thread accesses the Python interpreter at a time. A GIL has several advantages in single-threaded programs. However, it also makes &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-parallel-processing/"&gt;parallel processing&lt;/a&gt; harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in everything that happens under the hood in Python, then you won’t find better guides than Pablo and Łukasz. They’ve both been instrumental in several of the &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/search?q=new+features"&gt;recent new features&lt;/a&gt; of the language. Additionally, Pablo was the release manager for Python &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python310-new-features/"&gt;3.10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python311-new-features/"&gt;3.11&lt;/a&gt;, while Łukasz had the same role for Python &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python38-new-features/"&gt;3.8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python39-new-features/"&gt;3.9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Term Queries Aren’t the Same for Text and Keyword in OpenSearch and Elasticsearch</title>
      <link>https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/11/06/term-queries-text-keyword/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;term queries, text, keyword, OpenSearch, Elasticsearch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;term queries在OpenSearch和Elasticsearch中的区别&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;区分text term和keyword term queries的行为差异&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keyword term queries在输入分析器下的行为&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这种行为差异的起源和讨论&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于term queries的文档的差异&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文讨论了在OpenSearch和Elasticsearch中的term queries的不同行为。text term和keyword term queries的行为存在差异，在输入分析器下，keyword term queries会应用指定的分析器，而text term queries则不会。这种行为差异源于Elasticsearch并在OpenSearch中使用。虽然Elasticsearch在文档中明确指出了这一特性，但OpenSearch的文档中却没有提到。理解这种行为差异不仅有助于改进查询，还能提高检索到的数据的准确性，提升整体搜索体验。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the realm of data analytics and search technologies, term queries are an important tool created for exact matching. While they may seem straightforward, a surprising quirk needs careful attention. Watch out for the distinction in behavior for &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;keyword&lt;/code&gt; term queries in OpenSearch and Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common expectation for &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt; queries is that they will not modify your input value. If you&amp;#8217;re dealing with a &lt;code&gt;text term&lt;/code&gt; query, this theory holds true. However, an unexpected divergence occurs when you use &lt;code&gt;keyword term&lt;/code&gt; queries and apply input analyzers. This fundamental contrast creates different behaviors for &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;keyword&lt;/code&gt; queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why it Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are trying to find something specific, say “Waldo”, it may seem obvious to reach for a &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt; query such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-json"&gt;
{
    "query": {
        "term": {
            "people_found_here": {
                "value": "Waldo"
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the index you are hitting defines &lt;code&gt;people_found_here&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; field, you are unlikely to find a match, whereas if &lt;code&gt;people_found_here&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;keyword&lt;/code&gt; field, you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you&amp;#8217;re asking, “Why won&amp;#8217;t you find anything for &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt;”? The answer here lies in the fact that, by default (and in most configurations), &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; fields apply a &lt;code&gt;lowercase&lt;/code&gt; analyzer. As a result, the term “Waldo” will not exist, whereas “waldo” might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’re asking “How in the world will this be any different for keyword”? This is where the behavior shifts, as &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt; queries on &lt;code&gt;keyword&lt;/code&gt; fields will apply the analyzers specified in the index. As a result, if your &lt;code&gt;keyword&lt;/code&gt; field applies the &lt;code&gt;lowercase&lt;/code&gt; analyzer you just might find “Waldo” no matter where he is (or how he was stored).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How We Got Here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue was discussed in GitHub thread &lt;a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25487"&gt;25487&lt;/a&gt; where the community deliberated on the unique behavior of &lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt;. They ultimately decided they&amp;#8217;d retain this divergent behavior for &lt;code&gt;keyword term&lt;/code&gt; queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alteration originated within &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch"&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; but later found its way into OpenSearch. What&amp;#8217;s interesting is the subtle difference in how both search technologies document this behavior. Elasticsearch explicitly notes this particular trait in its documentation, which you can find &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/term-level-queries.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This inclusion alerts developers beforehand, giving them a chance to adapt their practices accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, the OpenSearch &lt;a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/2.10/query-dsl/term/index/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; does not mention this unique twist. The guidance on &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt; queries advises that they are suitable for &lt;code&gt;keyword&lt;/code&gt; use only, but it does not explicitly mention the application of input analyzers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Text vs. Keyword&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incongruity can lead to confusion among developers and users who transition between the two systems or rely on the documentation for clarification. Remember, &lt;code&gt;keyword term&lt;/code&gt; queries in both Elasticsearch and OpenSearch apply input analyzers, which may not be expected behavior based on standard term query definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we delve deeper into these advanced data analytics tools, it&amp;#8217;s essential to understand such distinct behaviors. This will not only help improve your queries but also give you better control over the data retrieved, enhancing the overall search experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say, the devil is in the details. In this case, understanding this detailed difference can save you from unexpected outcomes and lead to a more streamlined, accurate data search process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/11/06/term-queries-text-keyword/"&gt;Why Term Queries Aren&amp;#8217;t the Same for Text and Keyword in OpenSearch and Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com"&gt;Atomic Spin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing Dynamic PostgreSQL: How We Are Evolving the Database to Help You Sleep at Night</title>
      <link>https://www.timescale.com/blog/introducing-dynamic-postgresql/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic PostgreSQL &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;provisioned databases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;serverless databases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;price-performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compute range &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;问题1：开发人员过度预留计算资源的问题&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;问题2：服务器无数据库无法满足生产工作负载的问题&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;解决方案：引入Dynamic PostgreSQL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic PostgreSQL的优势和特点&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic PostgreSQL的价格和性能表现&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic PostgreSQL的使用和调整方法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic PostgreSQL是Timescale开发的一种动态数据库解决方案，旨在解决传统预置数据库和无服务器数据库所面临的问题。通过动态计算技术，Dynamic PostgreSQL可以根据负载自动扩展计算资源，从而提供卓越的价格性能比。与AWS RDS for PostgreSQL和AWS Aurora Serverless相比，迁移到Dynamic PostgreSQL的生产工作负载可以节省10-20%和50-70%的成本。Dynamic PostgreSQL的用户可以根据应用需求选择计算范围，基于基础计算和峰值计算的收费模式可以有效控制成本。通过优化存储和计算资源的使用，Dynamic PostgreSQL实现了更加高效和可预测的数据库管理。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img alt="Introducing Dynamic PostgreSQL: How We Are Evolving the Database to Help You Sleep at Night" src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2023/11/buy-the-base.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting today, &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?ref=timescale.com"&gt;you can create Dynamic PostgreSQL databases on Timescale&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic PostgreSQL is the natural evolution of cloud databases, solving the problems of both provisioned databases and serverless databases. It is backed by dynamic compute, a Timescale innovation that instantaneously scales your available compute within a predefined min/max range according to your load. Instead of provisioning for your peak (and paying for it at all times), you can now pick a compute range: your database will operate at base capacity and instantly access up to its peak only when needed. Buy the base, rent the peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This results in unparalleled price-performance: customers running production workloads will save 10-20&amp;#xa0;% when migrating from AWS RDS for PostgreSQL and 50-70&amp;#xa0;% when migrating from AWS Aurora Serverless.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try out Dynamic PostgreSQL today. &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?ref=timescale.com"&gt;We offer a free trial&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x2014;no credit card required&amp;#x2014;that gives you full access to the platform for 30 days.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create a Dynamic PostgreSQL service, just select the PostgreSQL option when logging into Timescale:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="Introducing Dynamic PostgreSQL: How We Are Evolving the Database to Help You Sleep at Night" class="kg-image" height="564" src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2023/11/Dynamic-PostgreSQL-The-Serverless-Database-Alternative-Timescale-Service.png" width="1133" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;You can now create Time Series services and PostgreSQL services on the Timescale platform&amp;#xa0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your application is always on, why shouldn&amp;#x2019;t your database be?&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="problem-1-developers-provision-far-more-compute-than-they-need"&gt;Problem 1: Developers provision far more compute than they need&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, ever since we first launched Timescale, we have had a front-row seat to how developers use databases. For example, just in the last few months, &lt;a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-we-scaled-postgresql-to-350-tb-with-10b-new-records-day/"&gt;we have analyzed over one trillion queries&lt;/a&gt; as part of our Insights product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing we have learned is that developers often provision far more compute than they actually need.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, this makes sense: You never want to worry about your database. Most database workloads are continuous, typically with some variability or burstiness to them. For example, a game that has more usage at night, a business application that has more usage during the day, or a connected home device that has more usage on the weekends than during the week.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="Introducing Dynamic PostgreSQL: How We Are Evolving the Database to Help You Sleep at Night" class="kg-image" height="352" src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2023/11/Dynamic-PostgreSQL-Alternative-to-Serverless-Database-workloads.png" width="1186" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You never want your database to run out of resources. If your database is at max capacity, that leads to a terrible customer experience (or no customer experience!). So, most developers end up provisioning for the peak, plus a buffer. This results in developers paying for much more compute than they actually need.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this seems crazy to us. What other business resource would organizations be okay spending far more than what they need? Wasted compute equals wasted money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="problem-2-serverless-databases-fall-short-for-production-workloads"&gt;Problem 2: Serverless databases fall short for production workloads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of you might be asking, &amp;#x201c;What about serverless databases?&amp;#x201d;&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of serverless originated with stateless workloads. After the success of virtual machines in the cloud, where users could stop needing to worry about hardware, they next asked why even worry about running application servers at all? After all, many users just wanted to run functions and only be charged for the time those functions were running. And it&amp;#x2019;s easy and seamless to spin up functions as needed, almost precisely because they are stateless. Serverless&amp;#x2014;and function-as-a-service or FaaS&amp;#x2014;became a hit, with AWS Lambda taking over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers then asked themselves, &amp;#x201c;Why pay for my database when I&amp;#x2019;m not using it?&amp;#x201d; The actual question is good: wasted resources are a massive database problem. And the practice of provisioning an AWS RDS database on a specific server instance (say, a db.m6gd.2xlarge) sure doesn&amp;#x2019;t feel modern or flexible: fixed CPU, fixed memory, fixed local disk. Most of it underutilized most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is where things get tricky: databases are very different from Lambda functions.&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serverless databases today are wrong for most production workloads for two main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serverless databases focus on the extremes for scaling up and down, even to zero.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serverless databases introduce much higher pricing to account for the resource &amp;#x201c;headroom&amp;#x201d; reserved to serve changing demands (and worse, often with pricing models that are hard to understand or predict).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x2019;s start by discussing the hot topic of &amp;#x201c;scale to zero.&amp;#x201d; The reality is that most production databases don&amp;#x2019;t need and won&amp;#x2019;t actually benefit from scaling to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there are some use cases where &amp;#x201c;scale to zero&amp;#x201d; makes sense. For example, proof-of-concept demos or more hobbyist applications. The ability to occasionally run an ad-hoc query against your dataset (AWS Athena and Google BigQuery make a strong case for a low-cost, serverless cloud data warehouse for very intermittent use). Another suitable use case would be to avoid forgetting to spin down a cloud dev instance once finished&amp;#x2014;there&amp;#x2019;s value in &amp;#x201c;auto pausing&amp;#x201d; a non-production database (although that requires much simpler functionality than envisioned by serverless).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But for your production database and in more operational settings? You don&amp;#x2019;t want to scale to zero.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling to zero means a &amp;#x201c;cold boot&amp;#x201d; on restart: empty database shared buffers, empty OS cache, empty catalog caches (in the case of PostgreSQL).&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Yes, some serverless databases lower the time it takes to start the database running, but they do so from an empty state. In a relational database like PostgreSQL, it can take minutes (or longer!) to build a warm working set again, especially for larger databases.)&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cold start performance hit is even greater as many serverless databases adopt different cloud storage architectures, where the cost and latency of fetching database pages from remote storage into memory is even greater. These overheads again lead to worse performance or force platform providers to compensate by using greater physical resources (e.g., Amazon Aurora databases have twice the memory of RDS), a cost that ultimately gets passed on to users.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in many scenarios, serverless databases end up with higher and unpredictable pricing.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you compare Aurora Serverless against Amazon RDS, you&amp;#x2019;ll see that 8 vCPU compute and 500 GB storage on Serverless is 85&amp;#xa0;% more expensive than RDS ($1,097 vs. $593). And this is using Aurora I/O Optimized and its more predictable storage prices, which launched just six months ago. (Although, even here, we still have to infer its actual compute capacity, as Aurora Serverless prices by confusing opaque &amp;#x201c;Aurora Capacity Units,&amp;#x201d; which to our best-informed estimates are 1 ACU = 0.25 vCPU.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&amp;#x2019;s note: &lt;/strong&gt;We&amp;#x2019;ll be publishing a complete benchmark backing those results soon. Stay tuned.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, with Aurora Standard, users would also pay for each internal I/O operation, which was nearly impossible to predict or budget. Many serverless databases continue to charge for such reads and writes.&amp;#xa0; In fact, when we benchmarked the serverless AWS Timestream, we saw &lt;a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/timescaledb-vs-amazon-timestream-6000x-higher-inserts-175x-faster-queries-220x-cheaper/"&gt;costs that ended up more than 100x higher&lt;/a&gt; than with Timescale due to all of these higher marginal costs.&amp;#xa0; The unpredictability and variability of costs were the opposite of worry-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, serverless databases are prone to poorer performance, unpredictable bills, and high costs as workloads scale. They are only well suited for intermittent workloads that spin up only occasionally and can tolerate cold starts with their lack of in-memory data caching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-developer-dilemma"&gt;The developer dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="Introducing Dynamic PostgreSQL: How We Are Evolving the Database to Help You Sleep at Night" class="kg-image" height="670" src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2023/11/Dynamic-PostgreSQL-Serverless-Database-Alternative-Devs-Dilemna.png" width="482" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where we have ended up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many developers still choose traditional DBaaS services with provisioning for production applications due to their reliable performance, control, and understandability, but hate the waste that arises from the necessity of overprovisioning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some developers choose serverless databases for their apparent cost savings, flexibility, and ease of use, but hate the performance hit and the unpredictable, obscure pricing (which often result in bills mysteriously higher than a provisioned instance).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As developers ourselves, neither of these options is very appealing! There is an opportunity for better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="solution-introducing-dynamic-postgresql"&gt;Solution: Introducing Dynamic PostgreSQL&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#x2019;s why we developed Dynamic PostgreSQL.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic PostgreSQL consistently supports your baseline and seamlessly scales compute when you need it, up to a defined max. This makes it perfect for the range of continuous workloads you typically see in production settings (whether uniform, variable, or bursty).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic PostgreSQL is 100&amp;#xa0;% PostgreSQL, with all the benefits of the PostgreSQL community and ecosystem, plus the &lt;a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/refining-a-mature-cloud-platform-cloud-week-at-timescale/"&gt;maturity of Timescale&amp;#x2019;s database platform&lt;/a&gt;. To build Dynamic PostgreSQL, we&amp;#x2019;ve innovated on how we operate our PostgreSQL infrastructure rather than modifying the internals of PostgreSQL. This gives you access to everything that PostgreSQL&amp;#x2014;and the Timescale platform&amp;#x2014;offers, without the fear of running on a forked PostgreSQL query or storage engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dynamic PostgreSQL, you choose a compute &lt;strong&gt;range&lt;/strong&gt; (a minimum and maximum CPU) corresponding&amp;#xa0;to your workload needs. This compute range also comes with effective memory that is equivalent to what most DBaaS services traditionally offer on the &amp;#x201c;maximum&amp;#x201d; end of the compute range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The base (minimum) of your CPU range acts exactly like the provisioned DBaaS model: the minimum CPU is at all times dedicated to your service to run your application. As your load increases&amp;#x2014;either due to your external application&amp;#x2019;s demand or even due to occasional internal database tasks like incremental backups or table auto-vacuuming&amp;#x2014;your database can use up to the peak (maximum) of your CPU range with zero delay.&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we achieve zero delay? Dynamic compute works differently than some other serverless or auto-scaling database offerings, so it doesn&amp;#x2019;t involve the slow scaling (and performance hit) you typically see from remote migrations. Instead, our infrastructure configuration and workload placement algorithms ensure that databases can scale up on their underlying node without restarts or reconfiguration. Your instance always has access to its maximum compute as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the best part is that you only pay for the base plus what you use above it. We call this model of choosing a compute range and scaling between it &amp;#x201c;&lt;strong&gt;buy the base, rent the peak&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#x201d;&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="Introducing Dynamic PostgreSQL: How We Are Evolving the Database to Help You Sleep at Night" class="kg-image" height="640" src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2023/11/buy-the-base-1.png" width="1120" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, if you choose a 4&amp;#x2013;8 CPU option, you will always have 4 CPUs dedicated to your service and 32&amp;#xa0;GB of effective memory. This ensures good base performance at all times. When your load increases, your application can use up to 8 CPUs instantaneously as it needs&amp;#x2014;metered and billed on a fractional CPU basis&amp;#x2014;and never more than 8 CPUs if this is your max limit.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dynamic model allows you to &amp;#x201c;size&amp;#x201d; your database more cost-effectively and worry-free. You can choose a compute range where your standard demand fits the minimum, yet you can grow or spike up to the peak (maximum) as needed. This maximum creates an inherent cap on any usage above your base compute, leading to an easy-to-understand cost ceiling. Further, we charge the same rate per (fractional) CPU-hour for both your base and any metered usage over this: there is no upcharge for using above your base, and therefore no price penalty for scaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you realize you provisioned a size range that is too low or too high, you can easily adjust your compute range to a size that better suits your application&amp;#x2019;s needs.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="Introducing Dynamic PostgreSQL: How We Are Evolving the Database to Help You Sleep at Night" class="kg-image" height="660" src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2023/11/Dynamic-PostgreSQL-Serverless-Database-Alternative-Meme.png" width="502" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="engineered-to-save-you-money"&gt;Engineered to save you money&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We currently offer five different compute ranges based on your workload size, with corresponding effective memory you receive for the range regardless of your instantaneous usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="Introducing Dynamic PostgreSQL: How We Are Evolving the Database to Help You Sleep at Night" class="kg-image" height="600" src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2023/11/Dynamic-PostgreSQL-Serverless-Database-Alternative-Table.png" width="973" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic PostgreSQL also uses &lt;a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/savings-unlocked-why-we-switched-to-a-pay-for-what-you-store-database-storage-model/"&gt;Timescale&amp;#x2019;s usage-based storage&lt;/a&gt;, where you only pay for the volume of data stored (in GB-hours), not for a provisioned disk size. No worrying about wasting money with an over-provisioned disk or similarly worrying that you&amp;#x2019;ll run out of disk space. Timescale&amp;#x2019;s dynamic cloud infrastructure ensures you have sufficient storage capacity, when you need it, and that you only pay for what you use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have developed Dynamic PostgreSQL intentionally to save you money. Customers running production workloads typically save 10-20&amp;#xa0;% when migrating from AWS RDS for PostgreSQL and 50-70&amp;#xa0;% when migrating from AWS Aurora Serverless.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the month, your bill consists of two simple, easy-to-understand metrics: (1) your compute costs, billed as your hourly base compute plus any fractional CPU usage above it but no more than your peak; and (2) your storage costs, billed as data consumption in GB-hours. There are no new metrics or derived units to measure or understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just pay for what you use. Zero extra costs or hidden fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compute: predictable, based on a defined range&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Storage: only pay for what you store&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wasted resources. No overpaying. No losing sleep at night. A bill you can explain to your boss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="try-it-today"&gt;Try it today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try out Dynamic PostgreSQL today! &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?ref=timescale.com"&gt;Timescale offers a free trial&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x2014;no credit card required&amp;#x2014;that gives you full access to the platform for 30 days.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MongoDB 6.0是MongoDB于2022年7月推出的一项重大更新，引入了许多新特性和改进，旨在减少复杂性，使用户不必经常进行故障排除，最终能够以更快的速度构建应用程序。新特性包括对时间序列数据的额外支持、改善的更改流功能、更深入的洞察和更快的查询、以及数据安全性和操作效率的新选项。这些新特性和改进使得用户能够更容易处理时间序列数据、实时数据修改和查询，并提高数据安全性和操作效率。总体而言，MongoDB 6.0的目标是优化开发和运维，消除数据孤岛，简化复杂架构，为创新和创造提供更具生产力的环境。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;MongoDB 6.0 is a major release by MongoDB launched in July 2022. In the release, MongoDB introduced a bunch of new features and improvements aimed at removing complexity – so that users don’t have to troubleshoot as often, and can ultimately build at a faster pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will find full support for the release in &lt;a href="https://severalnines.com/clustercontrol/"&gt;ClusterControl&lt;/a&gt;, as of version 1.9.7.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we will highlight seven new features in MongoDB 6.0 that add value for anyone using this particular database flavor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;1. Extra support for time series data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time series data is used across diverse industries, including finance, IoT, and telecommunications. With the way that modern applications have evolved, this type of data has become increasingly crucial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the last major release (MongoDB 5.0), the introduction of time series data meant that you could properly collect, process, and analyze it for access to new insights. The 5.0 release also overcame issues like high volume, storage and cost concerns, and gaps in data continuity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Support for time series data is extended in MongoDB 6.0, where secondary and compound indexes have been introduced for measurement – consequently increasing the read performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this, MongoDB has opened up the potential for geo-indexing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geo-indexing allows you to enrich and broaden your analysis, since scenarios involving distance and location can now be included as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, both query performance and sort operations also have been improved since the data point in series now can be efficiently produced without needing to scan the entire collection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;2. Improved change streams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern applications like Waze or Uber rely on event-driven architectures to handle real-time data such as activity feeds and notifications. They also need recommendation engines to provide seamless user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In these instances, the data will keep changing and requires the application to identify modifications in a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where the change streams feature introduced in MongoDB 3.6 comes into action. Change streams allow an API to stream any modifications to a MongoDB database, cluster, or collection without jeopardizing the performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MongoDB 6.0 has added new abilities to improve the way you can work with change streams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, you can get the before and after the state of a document that’s modified, which allows you to send revised versions of entire documents downstream, reference deleted documents, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, change streams in 6.0 now support data definition language (DDL) operations, such as creating or dropping collections and indexes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outcome? More responsive, scalable, and dynamic applications that align with user expectations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;3. Deeper insights and faster queries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Querying data is an essential element of database management. In MongoDB 6.0, MongoDB enhances the querying capabilities by introducing two key operators, $lookup and $graphlookup, improving JOINS and graph traversals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you can get full support for sharded deployments from both $lookup and $graphlookup in addition to the performance upgrade of $lookup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, if a larger number of documents are matched, $lookup performance will be twice as fast as the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can actually get results between five and ten times faster than previous iterations if you have a scenario where there is an index on the foreign key and a small number of documents have been matched.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MongoDB 6.0 now allows your applications to perform complicated analytical queries against a globally and transactionally consistent snapshot of your live, operational data. This is through the introduction of read concern snapshot and the optional atClusterTime parameter. With these features, the consistency of the query results returned to the users is well-conserved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;4. Additional operators for automation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, productivity is a number one priority for any development team. With MongoDB 6.0, you can now locate vital values in the data set with the introduction of an array of new operators like $maxN , $minN , or $lastN. In the event that you need to sort elements in an array directly in your aggregation pipelines, $sortArray operator can be leveraged to come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With these new operators, you spend less time manipulating the data manually and writing code. The new operators will automate essential commands and long lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, you should see a productivity boost and have more time to concentrate on other assignments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;5. Upgrades for initial sync and sharding&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Downtime is a nightmare for businesses, and database maintenance can be a significant contributor. This is one of the reasons why MongoDB introduced initial sync via file copy in MongoDB 6.0, which is up to four times faster than previously available methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that this feature is only available with MongoDB Enterprise Server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a side note, ClusterControl also supports MongoDB Enterprise clusters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides initial sync via file copy, MongoDB 6.0 also introduces significant improvements to sharding, the mechanism that facilitates horizontal scalability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The default chunk size for sharded collections has been increased to 128 MB. The benefit is that you will have lower chunk migrations and higher efficiency from both a networking standpoint and internal overhead at the query routing layer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, to reduce the impact of the sharding balancer, a new configureCollectionBalancing command has been introduced, allowing the defragmentation of a collection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;6. New options for data security and operational efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security and operational efficiency are critical considerations for any organization. MongoDB 6.0 introduces enhancements like extended support for KMIP-compliant key management providers for Client-Side Field-Level Encryption (CSFLE) which has been introduced since its launch in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This standardization streamlines cryptographic objects like encryption keys, certificates, and more while extending the efficiency of securing sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the version&amp;#8217;s encrypted audit events reinforce accountability, providing the confidentiality and integrity of logs, even when shared with central log management systems or SIEM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Announced at MongoDB World 2022, Queryable Encryption &amp;#8211; a groundbreaking feature is now available in preview. Queryable Encryption enables powerful queries on encrypted data while maintaining encryption until it is made available to the user.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This introduces a paradigm shift, allowing efficient data querying without the need for prior decryption, thus providing data security throughout its lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MongoDB 6.0&amp;#8217;s new features and improvements focus on optimizing development and operations, eliminating data silos, and simplifying complex architectures. This ultimately fosters a more productive environment for innovation and creation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The version adds a lot of value for anyone already using MongoDB, as well as anyone curious to test the technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ClusterControl provides full lifecycle support for both &lt;a href="https://severalnines.com/clustercontrol/databases/mongodb/"&gt;MongoDB 6.0 and the MongoDB enterprise binary&lt;/a&gt;, which you can try in a &lt;a href="https://severalnines.com/request-demo/"&gt;sandbox demo&lt;/a&gt; of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mimi Nishioka 是一位热爱设计和WordPress的日本设计师，在她的WordPress之旅中成为了活跃的贡献者和社区组织者。她通过组织学习小组，如Gutenberg Freaks和Design and WordPress，推动社区学习和知识分享。Mimi还关注翻译和本地化的重要性，致力于提高WordPress的语言可访问性。她最近参加了WordCamp US 2023，并计划着未来更深入地参与WordPress的开发和设计。通过她的努力和才华，Mimi正在打破障碍，建立本地社区，并为WordPress的发展做出贡献。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mimitips/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Yumi Nishioka&lt;/a&gt;, widely known as Mimi, is a Tokyo-based freelance web and UI designer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimi is very passionate about design and &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-wordpress" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, which led her to initiate two Japanese-language study groups around these subjects. Eventually, her dedication to the local WordPress community made her recognized – Mimi was the recipient of the &lt;a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/news/2023/2023-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-recipient-mimi/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;2023 Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This scholarship covered her traveling costs to WordCamp US, where she met with hundreds of WordPress enthusiasts and attended valuable sessions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Read on to get to know Mimi’s WordPress journey and how she has been pushing the limits to make the platform more accessible to everyone, regardless of language.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-embarking-on-the-wordpress-journey"&gt;Embarking on the WordPress Journey&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimi started out as a web designer, while designing logos and printed goods on the side. She has an extensive skill set, and is proficient in coding languages like &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-html" rel="follow"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimi particularly likes &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-css" rel="follow"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;I love CSS, and it continues to challenge me. But let’s get one thing straight – I am a designer at heart,&amp;#8221; Mimi emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This coding proficiency was not an afterthought but a necessity. In the early 2000s, ‘front-end engineering’ was still a foreign concept in Japan. Being a web designer at that time usually also meant being a coder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimi&amp;#8217;s first encounter with WordPress dates back to some time pre-2005, a period when building a simple &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-a-cms/" rel="follow"&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt; for your needs from scratch was considered the norm. Using her &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/video/what-is-php" rel="follow"&gt;PHP knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, she did just that. Her CMS worked nicely, so her small team began using it for client projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WordPress was still in its early years at that time. Mimi thought WordPress&amp;#8217; design wasn&amp;#8217;t outstanding back then, so she wasn’t immediately hooked by it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, fast forward to 2009, Mimi attended a PHP conference. It opened her eyes to the expansive world of WordPress. &lt;a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/nao/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Naoko Takano&lt;/a&gt;, a leading figure in the Japanese WordPress community, spoke about WordPress at that conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was still so rare for women in Japan to attend a tech event, let alone speak on stage. Seeing Naoko there was monumental for me,&amp;#8221; Mimi recalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimi then took a break from work to focus on her role as a mother of two. Once she returned to work, she realized WordPress had become super popular.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Almost all the projects I took after I gave birth were on WordPress,” Mimi says. However, she noticed that its growing popularity was a double-edged sword. On one hand, WordPress seemed like a magical tool that could accomplish anything. On the other hand, its misuse led to poorly constructed sites and &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/website-performance" rel="follow"&gt;performance issues&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;Some sites were so messy, it seemed like a patchwork of random code snippets from different blogs,&amp;#8221; she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her opinion changed once she found the &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/gutenberg-wordpress" rel="follow"&gt;Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; project. Intrigued by the changes, Mimi decided it was time to be part of the community. She started by attending a local study group. “The more I learned about it, the more interesting it became,” Mimi says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Mimi made her way to her first WordCamp in Tokyo in 2018, volunteering as a photographer. From there, Mimi has been an active WordPress contributor since.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fostering-community-through-design"&gt;Fostering Community Through Design&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Mimi, WordPress &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;block themes&lt;/a&gt; are especially helpful for designing as they follow a certain design system. She also acknowledges how WordPress enables designers to build sites without extensive coding knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimi is particularly interested in Figma and WordPress integration, and is developing a plugin to auto-generate &lt;a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/theme-json/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;theme.json files&lt;/a&gt;. “AI services and other tools can do it all for you, but I&amp;#8217;m taking it a bit slower to try to create something I can use the way I want,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She sees her commitment to WordPress as a hobby, not a business. Mimi is an unsponsored contributor but has been bringing a lot to the table. For example, she contributed to the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/07/evolving-the-fse-outreach-program/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Full Site Editing (FSE) Outreach Program&lt;/a&gt;, where she translated calls for testing to Japanese and gathered feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Mimi’s journey doesn’t stop at contributing to WordPress in her spare time. She has also found a way to create and nourish a sense of community through study groups. After serving as the lead organizer for &lt;a href="https://tokyo.wordcamp.org/2019/en/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp Tokyo 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Mimi realized she wanted to dig deeper into this CMS. Many conversations at these larger events were business-centric, and she yearned for more in-depth discussions on design and WordPress itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also noticed that many Japanese WordPress community members, including herself, sometimes struggled to express their fondness for design in English on the official &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Make WordPress&lt;/a&gt; Slack. This then led to the birth of the &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/@gutenbergfreaks9448?si=Uq7V22VoGoBEUQ-0" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Gutenberg Freaks&lt;/a&gt; study group in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg Freaks is a gathering of engineers who are enthusiastic about the Gutenberg editor. The group meets twice a month, reading the Gutenberg code together and discussing it in Japanese. The group also maintains a Discord channel for daily text chats, where they motivate each other to contribute to WordPress through writing issues and sending PRs (Pull Requests) on the WordPress GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Realizing the value of a design-centric dialogue, Mimi started another study group in 2020 named &lt;a href="https://web-design.connpass.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Design and WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. This group emerged from her collaboration with &lt;a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/nukaga/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Junko Nukaga&lt;/a&gt;, a Community Team Rep. It &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@wordpress5279/streams" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;holds open studies on YouTube monthly&lt;/a&gt;, focusing solely on WordPress’s design aspects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to focus even more on design. At first, I think perhaps we don’t need to separate the discussions and create a new study group. Still, sometimes conversations about design don&amp;#8217;t always resonate well with engineers,” Mimi explains her consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through these study groups, Mimi has learned a lot. From understanding coding languages to learning from issues raised by community members worldwide, the experience has been both educational and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shared community effort serves as a continuous learning opportunity, fueling Mimi’s enduring passion for design and WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovative-approaches-to-bridge-language-gaps"&gt;Innovative Approaches to Bridge Language Gaps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Continuing her eagerness to make WordPress and design more accessible, Mimi recognized a crucial factor that sometimes goes unnoticed: language. While WordPress serves a global audience, its documentation is primarily available in English. This poses a challenge, as over half of WordPress installations globally are in languages other than English.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m happy that the WordPress community has been discussing this matter at the &lt;a href="https://communitysummit.wordcamp.org/2023/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Community Summit 2023&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/project/2023/09/06/documentation-translation-localization/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;proposal for documentation localization&lt;/a&gt; was already submitted,” Mimi says. She emphasizes the importance of translating the Teams’ Handbooks, as it’s usually the entry point for new contributors. Doing so means democratizing access to information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Addressing the issue of language accessibility, Mimi reflects on how the Japanese community uses a scraping tool to extract data from GitHub and translate the data. &lt;a href="https://github.com/mirucon/wp-handbook-converter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;The scraping tool was developed by Mirucon&lt;/a&gt;, an engineer and fellow Japanese WordPress contributor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Japanese WordPress community is very active in translation, so we can get around with the handbooks. But I think this is not the case in other countries. Japan is blessed in this matter,” Mimi contemplates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimi is not only concerned about the translation but also the quality of information available. She noticed many wrong or outdated information about WordPress in countless blogs on the internet. This proliferation of misinformation can result in skepticism. Therefore, Mimi emphasizes the need to maintain up-to-date official documentation translation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what’s her call to action? While she knows that translating documentation and ensuring its accuracy is a huge undertaking, she strongly believes in its necessity. &amp;#8220;This is a lot of work, but I would love to help it go well,&amp;#8221; Mimi says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this way, Mimi continues to help break the barriers that may hold people back from fully engaging with WordPress. Whether creating local-language study groups or making information more accessible, she’s showing that where there’s a will, there’s always a way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-unforgettable-wordcamp-us-2023-and-future-aspirations"&gt;The Unforgettable WordCamp US 2023 and Future Aspirations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attending &lt;a href="https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp US 2023&lt;/a&gt; was more than just a trip to a conference for Mimi – it was a wonderful experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimi was encouraged to apply for the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship by her friend and design study group co-founder, Junko. She was then chosen as this year&amp;#8217;s recipient. She really appreciates this incredible opportunity, but sometimes she just cannot shake the thought that someone else might better deserve the honor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the event, she met many incredible people doing remarkable work in the WordPress community. Mimi is particularly amazed by the women in tech she met there. It was a dream come true for her to converse with Core committers who have inspired her journey in WordPress. Their activities have encouraged Mimi to make the most of her expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was also thrilled by the WordPress community members’ kindness and the welcoming atmosphere she encountered at the WordCamp, which boosted her spirits and made her long travel worthwhile. WordCamp US 2023 was a fulfilling adventure from start to finish, packed with memorable moments and new friendships.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about her current aspirations, Mimi said she wants to focus more on creating rather than processing and distributing information like she has been doing with her study groups and localization efforts. With her two friends, Mimi has been focusing more on her theme.json generator plugin while doing her main designing job. It’s still a prototype now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am currently working on my plugin&amp;#8217;s vertical writing functionality. I am delighted to see the vertical writing feature added to WordPress, but it’s still not like the vertical writing users expected,&amp;#8221; Mimi says. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m planning to create a GitHub issue about it, to gather insights from the Japanese community and people from other locales with a vertical writing culture. I’d like to invite them to share their opinions about this aspect,&amp;#8221; she continues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimi also emphasizes that the vertical writing functionality is more than just a tiny feature improvement – it’s a culture. “It’s also related to the upcoming &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Gutenberg Phase 4&lt;/a&gt;’s focus, which is the implementation of multilingual sites to WordPress’s core. If we are going to move forward with multilingualism, we need to gather a broader range of opinions from people who are used to dealing with multilingualism,” Mimi argues.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="the homepage of Mimi's blog, Photosynthesic" class="wp-image-5735" height="467" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/mimi-blog-homepage-1024x467.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.photosynthesic.jp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Her blog&lt;/a&gt;, which started as a testing ground for WordPress, serves as an informal journal where she records her experiences with WordPress and other tech-related subjects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, the posts are all in Japanese, and Mimi plans to enrich the blog by adding more articles in English and about design. However, as Mimi sees a blog as a log, she will continue to post such miscellaneous articles at her pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Mimi, that is the beauty of WordPress – it provides everyone access to publish. Therefore, she believes it should come with better language accessibility and efforts in community learning. While her focus has evolved, her mission is constant: to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s this continuous commitment that places her among the women she once admired – the inspiring figures shaping the WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Custom Traits and SwiftUI</title>
      <link>https://useyourloaf.com/blog/custom-traits-and-swiftui/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting with iOS 17 you can add your own custom traits to the UIKit trait environment and have them interoperate with the SwiftUI environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="trait-changes-in-ios-17"&gt;Trait Changes in iOS 17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple added the &lt;code&gt;UITraitEnvironment&lt;/code&gt; protocol way back in iOS 8. It adds a &lt;code&gt;traitCollection&lt;/code&gt; property and &lt;code&gt;traitCollectionDidChange&lt;/code&gt; method to conforming types including &lt;code&gt;UIScreen&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UIWindowScene&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In iOS 17, Apple made significant changes to the handling of traits and deprecated some earlier trait related methods&lt;/strong&gt;. See &lt;a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/registering-for-trait-changes/"&gt;registering for trait changes&lt;/a&gt; for the new way to observe trait changes that deprecates &lt;code&gt;traitCollectionDidChange&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in iOS 17, we can add our own &lt;strong&gt;custom traits&lt;/strong&gt; to a trait collection. Even better you can bridge them to the SwiftUI environment for any hosted SwiftUI views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom traits are well suited for passing simple value types down many levels of the view hierarchy. Apple recommends against using classes as trait values. Since the system also compares trait values often you should make sure that checking your trait type for equality is fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="creating-a-custom-trait"&gt;Creating A Custom Trait&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve created &lt;a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftui-custom-environment-values/"&gt;SwiftUI custom environment values&lt;/a&gt; you may notice that creating a custom UIKit trait is familiar. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s create a custom trait for a boolean feature flag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create the trait definition&lt;/strong&gt;. All traits contained in a &lt;code&gt;UITraitCollection&lt;/code&gt; conform to the &lt;code&gt;UITraitDefinition&lt;/code&gt; protocol. We create a new trait by defining our own conforming type. Like a SwiftUI environment key we need to give it a default value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UITraitDefinition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;defaultValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend the trait collection class&lt;/strong&gt; to include a getter for our custom attribute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;UITraitCollection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend the mutable traits protocol&lt;/strong&gt;, new in iOS 17, to allow reading and modifying the custom trait:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;UIMutableTraits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;     &lt;span class="kr"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;     &lt;span class="kr"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;newValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When conforming the custom trait to &lt;code&gt;UITraitDefinition&lt;/code&gt; the only requirement is to provide a default value but there are some optional steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re creating a trait that &lt;strong&gt;affects the color appearance&lt;/strong&gt; of a view you should set the &lt;code&gt;affectsColorAppearance&lt;/code&gt; property to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. This causes the system to redraw views when the trait changes. For example, if I had a trait for the theme of my app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ThemeTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UITraitDefinition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;defaultValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;affectsColorAppearance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traits have a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; that as far as I can tell is only used for debugging. It  defaults to the name of the type but you can change it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UITraitDefinition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;defaultValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"FeatureOne"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can optionally set an &lt;strong&gt;identifier&lt;/strong&gt; for a trait. That becomes useful if you want to encode or persist the trait. Apple recommends you use reverse-DNS format to make the identifier globally unique in the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UITraitDefinition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;defaultValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;identifer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"com.useyourloaf.myapp.featureOne"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="overriding-a-custom-trait"&gt;Overriding A Custom Trait&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give your custom trait a value other than its default you need to apply a trait override somewhere in the view hierarchy. The way you &lt;strong&gt;override traits&lt;/strong&gt; also changed in iOS 17 to use the new &lt;code&gt;traitOverrides&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;traitCollection&lt;/code&gt; property of a &lt;code&gt;UITraitEnvironment&lt;/code&gt; type is read-only. To apply an override you set the &lt;code&gt;traitOverrides&lt;/code&gt;property of a &lt;code&gt;UIWindowScene&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UIWindow&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UIPresentationController&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;windowScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;traitOverrides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note : The &lt;code&gt;UIScreen&lt;/code&gt; class, which does conform to &lt;code&gt;UITraitEnvironment&lt;/code&gt; does not support the new trait overrides mechanism for custom traits. &lt;strong&gt;The window scene is the highest point in the view hierarchy where you can override traits&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trait environments flow down the view hierarchy from the window scene, window, parent view controller, views and on down into any child view controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple made a subtle change to the way you inherit traits in iOS 17&lt;/strong&gt;. Before iOS 17, child view controllers inherited their traits from the parent view controller, ignoring any traits of the views of the parent. In iOS 17, traits flow down through view controllers and views so a child view controller inherits traits from its superview in the parent view controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-practical-example"&gt;A Practical Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a practical example where I want to apply my feature flag trait override at the window scene. I&amp;rsquo;m saving and restoring the value of my trait to user defaults, using the trait identifier as the key. In my &lt;strong&gt;scene delegate&lt;/strong&gt;, when the scene first connects to its window I read the value of the trait from user defaults and apply the &lt;strong&gt;trait override to the window scene&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SceneDelegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIResponder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIWindowSceneDelegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIWindow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;willConnectTo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UISceneSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;connectionOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ConnectionOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;guard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIWindowScene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;standard&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;forKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;identifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;traitOverrides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also want to register for trait changes so that I can save my trait back to user defaults if it changes (see &lt;a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/registering-for-trait-changes/"&gt;registering for trait changes&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;registerForTraitChanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;      &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;windowScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIWindowScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;       &lt;span class="n"&gt;previousTraitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UITraitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;         &lt;span class="n"&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;windowScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;traitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;           &lt;span class="n"&gt;forKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;identifer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My custom trait is now available to any view controllers or views in the view hierarchy of the window scene in their &lt;code&gt;traitCollection&lt;/code&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;traitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if I have view controller that depends on the feature trait. I can have it register for changes to the trait on the view controllers trait collection and update as needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FeatureViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;@IBOutlet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;weak&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;featureLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UILabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="kc"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;registerForTraitChanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;      &lt;span class="n"&gt;previousTraitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UITraitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;      &lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enableFeature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;traitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;viewIsAppearing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;enableFeature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;featureLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Enabled"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;                                  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Disabled"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the use of &lt;a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/uikit-view-lifecycle-viewisappearing/"&gt;viewIsAppearing&lt;/a&gt; to set the initial state of the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to change the value of the trait override applied to the window scene you can get the scene from the window of any view. For example, a method in a view controller that enables/disables the feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;@IBAction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;featureOneChanged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UISwitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;windowScene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;windowScene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;windowScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;traitOverrides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isOn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="handling-multiple-windows"&gt;Handling Multiple Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple don&amp;rsquo;t provide any guidance on how to manage custom traits for situations like an iPad app that has multiple windows. In my testing, I&amp;rsquo;ve found it best to have the scene delegate manage any app-wide custom traits, applying the trait override at the window scene level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an iPad app with multiple windows any of the scenes could potentially change the value of my custom trait. My other scenes need to observe that change and update their trait override. In my example, I&amp;rsquo;m persisting the trait to user defaults so I added an observer for changes to the user defaults database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my scene delegate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NotificationCenter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;addObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;#selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;defaultsDidChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;didChangeNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then when the notification arrives I override the trait for the scene to keep each scene in sync:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;@objc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;defaultsDidChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;guard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;windowScene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;standard&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;forKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;identifer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;traitOverrides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;traitOverrides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="bridging-traits-and-the-swiftui-environment"&gt;Bridging Traits and the SwiftUI Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m assuming the reason Apple made these improvements to the UIKit trait environment is to improve &lt;strong&gt;interoperability with SwiftUI&lt;/strong&gt;. This reminds me a lot of the &lt;a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/using-objective-c-lightweight-generics/"&gt;Objective-C improvements&lt;/a&gt; we saw to improve interoperability with Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bridge our custom trait to the SwiftUI environment we start by creating the corresponding custom SwiftUI environment key (see &lt;a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftui-custom-environment-values/"&gt;SwiftUI custom environment values&lt;/a&gt;) and then add conformance to &lt;code&gt;UITraitBridgedEnvironmentKey&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the SwiftUI environment key with a default value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FeatureOneKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EnvironmentKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;defaultValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extend the environment with a getter/setter for our key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;EnvironmentValues&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureOneKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;newValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridge to the UIKit trait by adding conformance to &lt;code&gt;UITraitBridgedEnvironmentKey&lt;/code&gt;. This requires a read method that returns the value of the UIKit trait and a write method to set the value of the UIKit mutable trait:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FeatureOneKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UITraitBridgedEnvironmentKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;traitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UITraitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;traitCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mutableTraits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;inout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIMutableTraits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mutableTraits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any SwiftUI view in our view hierarchy can now access the UIKit trait using the SwiftUI environment. For example, here&amp;rsquo;s a feature view that reads the trait from the environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FeatureView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;systemName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;featureOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"checkmark.seal.fill"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;                                    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"xmark.seal.fill"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resizable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;aspectRatio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;contentMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foregroundStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I created a hosting view controller for the SwiftUI view that I added as child view controller of my feature view controller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HostedFeatureController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIHostingController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aDecoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSCoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;    &lt;span class="kc"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aDecoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rootView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FeatureView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Storyboard showing view controller with embedded child hosted feature controller" height="460" src="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/custom-traits-and-swiftui/001.png" width="450" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My SwiftUI feature view now updates to any changes made to the UIKit trait override I set in the window scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Device screenshot showing feature one enabled and blue checkmark" height="639" src="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/custom-traits-and-swiftui/002.png" width="295" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the final custom trait definition for reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code class="language-swift"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// FeatureTrait.swift&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;UIKit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FeatureOneTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UITraitDefinition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;defaultValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>git rebase: what can go wrong?</title>
      <link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/06/rebasing-what-can-go-wrong-/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! While talking with folks about Git, I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing a comment over and
over to the effect of &amp;ldquo;I hate rebase&amp;rdquo;. People seemed to feel pretty strongly
about this, and I was really surprised because I don&amp;rsquo;t run into a lot of
problems with rebase and I use it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that if many people have a very strong opinion that&amp;rsquo;s different from
mine, usually it&amp;rsquo;s because they have different experiences around that thing
from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I asked on &lt;a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/111342083852635579"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about the tradeoffs of using &lt;code&gt;git rebase&lt;/code&gt; a bit. I think
the goal of rebase is to have a nice linear commit history, which is something
I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but what are the &lt;em&gt;costs&lt;/em&gt; of using rebase? what problems has it caused for you
in practice? I&amp;rsquo;m really only interested in specific bad experiences you&amp;rsquo;ve had
here &amp;ndash; not opinions or general statements like “rewriting history is bad”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a huge number of incredible answers to this, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best
to summarize them here. I&amp;rsquo;ll also mention solutions or workarounds to those
problems in cases where I know of a solution. Here&amp;rsquo;s the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#fixing-the-same-conflict-repeatedly-is-annoying"&gt;fixing the same conflict repeatedly is annoying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#rebasing-a-lot-of-commits-is-hard"&gt;rebasing a lot of commits is hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#undoing-a-rebase-is-hard"&gt;undoing a rebase is hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#force-pushing-to-shared-branches-can-cause-lost-work"&gt;force pushing to shared branches can cause lost work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#force-pushing-makes-code-reviews-harder"&gt;force pushing makes code reviews harder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#losing-commit-metadata"&gt;losing commit metadata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#rebasing-can-break-intermediate-commits"&gt;rebasing can break intermediate commits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#accidentally-run-git-commit-amend-instead-of-git-rebase-continue"&gt;accidentally run git commit &amp;ndash;amend instead of git rebase &amp;ndash;continue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#splitting-commits-in-an-interactive-rebase-is-hard"&gt;splitting commits in an interactive rebase is hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#complex-rebases-are-hard"&gt;complex rebases are hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#rebasing-long-lived-branches-can-be-annoying"&gt;rebasing long lived branches can be annoying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#rebase-and-commit-discipline"&gt;rebase and commit discipline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#a-squash-and-merge-workflow"&gt;a &amp;ldquo;squash and merge&amp;rdquo; workflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml#miscellaneous-problems"&gt;miscellaneous problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal with this isn&amp;rsquo;t to convince anyone that rebase is bad and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
use it (I&amp;rsquo;m certainly going to keep using rebase!). But seeing all these
problems made me want to be more cautious about recommending rebase to
newcomers without explaining how to use it safely. It also makes me wonder if
there&amp;rsquo;s an easier workflow for cleaning up your commit history that&amp;rsquo;s harder to
accidentally mess up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="my-git-workflow-assumptions"&gt;my git workflow assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I know that people use a lot of different Git workflows. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be
talking about the workflow I&amp;rsquo;m used to when working on a team, which is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the team uses a central Github/Gitlab repo to coordinate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s one central &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch. It&amp;rsquo;s protected from force pushes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people write code in feature branches and make pull requests to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web service is deployed from &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; every time a pull request is merged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only way to make a change to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is by making a pull request on Github/Gitlab and merging it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the only &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; git workflow (it&amp;rsquo;s a very &amp;ldquo;we run a web service&amp;rdquo;
workflow and open source project or desktop software with releases generally
use a slightly different workflow). But it&amp;rsquo;s what I know so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ll
talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="two-kinds-of-rebase"&gt;two kinds of rebase&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also before we start: one big thing I noticed is that there were 2 different kinds of rebase that kept coming up, and only one of them requires you to deal with merge conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rebasing on an ancestor&lt;/strong&gt;, like &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i HEAD^^^^^^^&lt;/code&gt; to squash many
small commits into one. As long as you&amp;rsquo;re just squashing commits, you&amp;rsquo;ll
never have to resolve a merge conflict while doing this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rebasing onto a branch that has diverged&lt;/strong&gt;, like &lt;code&gt;git rebase main&lt;/code&gt;. This can cause merge conflicts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s useful to make this distinction because sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m thinking
about rebase type 1 (which is a lot less likely to cause problems), but people
who are struggling with it are thinking about rebase type 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s move on to all the problems!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fixing-the-same-conflict-repeatedly-is-annoying"&gt;fixing the same conflict repeatedly is annoying&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you make many tiny commits, sometimes you end up in a hellish loop where you
have to fix the same merge conflict 10 times.  You can also end up fixing merge
conflicts totally unnecessarily (like dealing with a merge conflict in code
that a future commit deletes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to make this better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first do a &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i HEAD^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/code&gt; to squash all of the tiny commits
into 1 big commit and then a &lt;code&gt;git rebase main&lt;/code&gt; to rebase onto a different
branch. Then you only have to fix the conflicts once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;code&gt;git rerere&lt;/code&gt; to automate repeatedly resolving the same merge conflicts
(&amp;ldquo;rerere&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;reuse recorded resolution&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;ll record your previous merge conflict resolutions and replay them).
I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried this but I think you need to set &lt;code&gt;git config rerere.enabled
true&lt;/code&gt; and then it&amp;rsquo;ll automatically help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if I find myself resolving merge conflicts more than once in a rebase,
I&amp;rsquo;ll usually run &lt;code&gt;git rebase --abort&lt;/code&gt; to stop it and then squash my commits into
one and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rebasing-a-lot-of-commits-is-hard"&gt;rebasing a lot of commits is hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally when I&amp;rsquo;m doing a rebase onto a different branch, I&amp;rsquo;m rebasing 1-2
commits. Maybe sometimes 5! Usually there are no conflicts and it works
fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people described rebasing hundreds of commits by many different people onto
a different branch. That sounds really difficult and I don&amp;rsquo;t envy that task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="undoing-a-rebase-is-hard"&gt;undoing a rebase is hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard from several people that when they were new to rebase, they messed up a
rebase and permanently lost a week of work that they then had to redo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that undoing a rebase that went wrong is &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; more complicated
than undoing a merge that went wrong (you can undo a bad merge with something like &lt;code&gt;git reset --hard HEAD^&lt;/code&gt;).
Many newcomers to rebase don&amp;rsquo;t even realize that undoing a rebase is even
possible, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it is possible to undo a rebase that went wrong. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of how to undo a rebase using &lt;code&gt;git reflog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Do a bad rebase (for example run &lt;code&gt;git rebase -I HEAD^^^^^&lt;/code&gt; and just delete 3 commits)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 2&lt;/strong&gt;:  Run &lt;code&gt;git reflog&lt;/code&gt;. You should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ee244c4 (HEAD -&amp;gt; main) HEAD@{0}: rebase (finish): returning to refs/heads/main
ee244c4 (HEAD -&amp;gt; main) HEAD@{1}: rebase (pick): test
fdb8d73 HEAD@{2}: rebase (start): checkout HEAD^^^^^^^
ca7fe25 HEAD@{3}: commit: 16 bits by default
073bc72 HEAD@{4}: commit: only show tooltips on desktop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Find the entry immediately before &lt;code&gt;rebase (start)&lt;/code&gt;. In my case that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;ca7fe25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step 4&lt;/strong&gt;:  Run &lt;code&gt;git reset --hard ca7fe25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution folks mentioned to &amp;ldquo;undoing a rebase is hard&amp;rdquo; that avoids having
to use the reflog is to make a &amp;ldquo;backup branch&amp;rdquo; with &lt;code&gt;git switch -c backup&lt;/code&gt;
before rebasing, so you can easily get back to the old commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="force-pushing-to-shared-branches-can-cause-lost-work"&gt;force pushing to shared branches can cause lost work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people mentioned the following situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re collaborating on a branch with someone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You push some changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They rebase the branch and run &lt;code&gt;git push --force&lt;/code&gt; (maybe by accident)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now when you run &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a mess &amp;ndash; you get the a &lt;code&gt;fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches&lt;/code&gt; error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While trying to deal with the fallout you might lose some commits, especially if some of the people are involved aren&amp;rsquo;t very comfortable with git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an even worse situation than the &amp;ldquo;undoing a rebase is hard&amp;rdquo; situation
because the missing commits might be split across many different people&amp;rsquo;s and
the only worse thing than having to hunt through the reflog is multiple
different people having to hunt through the reflog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has never happened to me because the only branch I&amp;rsquo;ve ever collaborated on
is &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; has always been protected from force pushing (in my
experience the only way you can get something into &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is through a pull
request). So I&amp;rsquo;ve never even really been in a situation where this &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;
happen. But I can definitely see how this would cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main tools I know to avoid this are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t rebase on shared branches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;code&gt;--force-with-lease&lt;/code&gt; when force pushing, to make sure that nobody else has pushed to the branch since your last fetch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the &amp;ldquo;since your last &lt;strong&gt;fetch&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is important here &amp;ndash; if you run &lt;code&gt;git
fetch&lt;/code&gt; immediately before running &lt;code&gt;git push --force-with-lease&lt;/code&gt;, the
&lt;code&gt;--force-with-lease&lt;/code&gt; won&amp;rsquo;t protect you at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was curious about why people would run &lt;code&gt;git push --force&lt;/code&gt; on a shared branch. Some reasons people gave were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they&amp;rsquo;re working on a collaborative feature branch, and the feature branch needs to be rebased onto &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;. The idea here is that you&amp;rsquo;re just really careful about coordinating the rebase so nothing gets lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as an open source maintainer, sometimes they need to rebase a contributor&amp;rsquo;s branch to fix a merge conflict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they&amp;rsquo;re new to git, read some instructions online that suggested &lt;code&gt;git rebase&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git push --force&lt;/code&gt; as a solution, and followed them without understanding the consequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they&amp;rsquo;re used to doing &lt;code&gt;git push --force&lt;/code&gt; on a personal branch and ran it on a shared branch by accident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="force-pushing-makes-code-reviews-harder"&gt;force pushing makes code reviews harder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation here is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You make a pull request on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People leave some comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You update the code to address the comments, rebase to clean up your commits, and force push&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now when the reviewer comes back, it&amp;rsquo;s hard for them to tell what you changed since the last time you saw it &amp;ndash; all the commits show up as &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to avoid this is to push new commits addressing the review comments,
and then after the PR is approved do a rebase to reorganize everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think some reviewers are more annoyed by this problem than others, it&amp;rsquo;s kind
of a personal preference. Also this might be a Github-specific issue, other
code review tools might have better tools for managing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="losing-commit-metadata"&gt;losing commit metadata&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re rebasing to squash commits, you can lose important commit metadata
like &lt;code&gt;Co-Authored-By&lt;/code&gt;. Also if you GPG sign your commits, rebase loses the
signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s probably other commit metadata that you can lose that I&amp;rsquo;m not thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t run into this one so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to avoid it. I think GPG
signing commits isn&amp;rsquo;t as popular as it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rebasing-can-break-intermediate-commits"&gt;rebasing can break intermediate commits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to have a very clean commit history where the tests pass on
every commit (very admirable!), rebasing can result in some intermediate
commits that are broken and don&amp;rsquo;t pass the tests, even if the final commit
passes the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently you can avoid this by using &lt;code&gt;git rebase -x&lt;/code&gt; to run the test suite at
every step of the rebase and make sure that the tests are still passing. I&amp;rsquo;ve
never done that though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="accidentally-run-git-commit-amend-instead-of-git-rebase-continue"&gt;accidentally run &lt;code&gt;git commit --amend&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;git rebase --continue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of people mentioned issues with running &lt;code&gt;git commit --amend&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;git rebase --continue&lt;/code&gt; when resolving a merge conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this is confusing is that there are two reasons when you might want to edit files during a rebase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;editing a commit (by using &lt;code&gt;edit&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i&lt;/code&gt;), where you need to write &lt;code&gt;git commit --amend&lt;/code&gt; when you&amp;rsquo;re done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a merge conflict, where you need to run &lt;code&gt;git rebase --continue&lt;/code&gt; when you&amp;rsquo;re done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get these two cases mixed up because they feel very similar. I think what goes wrong here is that you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a rebase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run into a merge conflict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolve the merge conflict, and run &lt;code&gt;git add file.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt; because that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re used to doing after you run &lt;code&gt;git add&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But you were supposed to run &lt;code&gt;git rebase --continue&lt;/code&gt;! Now you have a weird extra commit, and maybe it has the wrong commit message and/or author&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="splitting-commits-in-an-interactive-rebase-is-hard"&gt;splitting commits in an interactive rebase is hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole point of rebase is to clean up your commit history, and &lt;strong&gt;combining&lt;/strong&gt;
commits with rebase is pretty easy. But what if you want to split up a commit into 2
smaller commits? It&amp;rsquo;s not as easy, especially if the commit you want to split
is a few commits back! I actually don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to do it even though I
feel very comfortable with rebase. I&amp;rsquo;d probably just do &lt;code&gt;git reset HEAD^^^&lt;/code&gt;  or
something and use &lt;code&gt;git add -p&lt;/code&gt; to redo all my commits from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One person shared &lt;a href="https://github.com/kimgr/git-rewrite-guide#split-a-commit"&gt;their workflow for splitting commits with rebase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="complex-rebases-are-hard"&gt;complex rebases are hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to do too many things in a single &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i&lt;/code&gt; (reorder commits
AND combine commits AND modify a commit), it can get really confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this, I personally prefer to only do 1 thing per rebase, and if I want
to do 2 different things I&amp;rsquo;ll do 2 rebases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rebasing-long-lived-branches-can-be-annoying"&gt;rebasing long lived branches can be annoying&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your branch is long-lived (like for 1 month), having to rebase repeatedly
gets painful. It might be easier to just do 1 merge at the end and only resolve
the conflicts once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dream is to avoid this problem by not having long-lived branches but it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work out that way in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="miscellaneous-problems"&gt;miscellaneous problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more issues that I think are not that common:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stopping a rebase wrong&lt;/strong&gt;: If you try to abort a rebase that&amp;rsquo;s going badly with
&lt;code&gt;git reset --hard&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;git rebase --abort&lt;/code&gt;, things will behave
weirdly until you stop it properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weird interactions with merge commits&lt;/strong&gt;: A couple of quotes about this: &amp;ldquo;If you
rebase your working copy to keep a clean history for a branch, but the
underlying project uses merges, the result can be ugly. If you do rebase -i
HEAD~4 and the fourth commit back is a merge, you can see dozens of commits
in the interactive editor.&amp;ldquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the hard way to &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; rebase if
I&amp;rsquo;ve merged anything from another branch&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rebase-and-commit-discipline"&gt;rebase and commit discipline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of people arguing about rebase. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about why
this is and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that people work at a few different levels of &amp;ldquo;commit
discipline&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literally anything goes, &amp;ldquo;wip&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;idk&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;add thing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you make a pull request (on github/gitlab), squash all of your crappy commits into a single commit with a reasonable message (usually the PR title)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic Beautiful Commits &amp;ndash; every change is split into the appropriate
number of commits, where each one has a nice commit message and where they
all tell a story around the change you&amp;rsquo;re making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often I think different people inside the same company have different levels of
commit discipline, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people argue about this a lot. Personally I&amp;rsquo;m
mostly a Level 2 person. I think Level 3 might be what people mean when they say
&amp;ldquo;clean commit history&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Level 1 and Level 2 are pretty easy to achieve without rebase &amp;ndash; for
level 1, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything, and for level 2, you can either press
&amp;ldquo;squash and merge&amp;rdquo; in github or run &lt;code&gt;git switch main; git merge --squash mybranch&lt;/code&gt; on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for Level 3, you either need rebase or some other tool (like GitUp) to help
you organize your commits to tell a nice story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering if when people argue about whether people &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; use
rebase or not, they&amp;rsquo;re really arguing about which minimum level of commit
discipline should be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think how this plays out also depends on how big the changes folks are making &amp;ndash;
if folks are usually making pretty small pull requests anyway, squashing them
into 1 commit isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal, but if you&amp;rsquo;re making a 6000-line change you
probably want to split it up into multiple commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-squash-and-merge-workflow"&gt;a &amp;ldquo;squash and merge&amp;rdquo; workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of people mentioned using this workflow that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use rebase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make commits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;git merge main&lt;/code&gt; to merge main into the branch periodically (and fix conflicts if necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re done, use GitHub&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;squash and merge&amp;rdquo; feature (which is the
equivalent of running &lt;code&gt;git checkout main; git merge --squash mybranch&lt;/code&gt;) to
squash all of the changes into 1 commit. This gets rid of all the &amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;rdquo; merge
commits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally thought this would make the log of commits on my branch too ugly,
but apparently &lt;code&gt;git log main..mybranch&lt;/code&gt; will just show you the changes on your
branch, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git log main..mybranch
756d4af (HEAD -&amp;gt; mybranch) Merge branch 'main' into mybranch
20106fd Merge branch 'main' into mybranch
d7da423 some commit on my branch
85a5d7d some other commit on my branch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the goal here isn&amp;rsquo;t to &lt;strong&gt;force&lt;/strong&gt; people who have made beautiful
atomic commits to squash their commits &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just to provide an easy
option for folks to clean up a messy commit history (&amp;ldquo;add new feature; wip;
wip; fix; fix; fix; fix; fix;&amp;ldquo;) without having to use rebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be curious to hear about other people who use a workflow like this and if
it works well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="there-are-more-problems-than-i-expected"&gt;there are more problems than I expected&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into this really feeling like &amp;ldquo;rebase is fine, what could go wrong?&amp;rdquo; But
many of these problems actually have happened to me in the past, it&amp;rsquo;s just that
over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to avoid or fix all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;ve never really seen anyone share best practices for rebase, other than
&amp;ldquo;never force push to a shared branch&amp;rdquo;. All of these honestly make me a lot more
reluctant to recommend using rebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, I think these are my personal rebase rules I follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stop a rebase if it&amp;rsquo;s going badly instead of letting it finish (with &lt;code&gt;git rebase --abort&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;know how to use &lt;code&gt;git reflog&lt;/code&gt; to undo a bad rebase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t rebase a million tiny commits (instead do it in 2 steps: &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i HEAD^^^^&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;git rebase main&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t do more than one thing in a &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i&lt;/code&gt;. Keep it simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never force push to a shared branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never rebase commits that have already been pushed to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
Thanks to Marco Rogers for encouraging me to think about the problems people
have with rebase, and to everyone on Mastodon who helped with this.

&lt;p&gt;本文讲述了一个设施在电源中断时面临的问题，由于未经充分规划，在电源中断后需要花费大量时间找到唯一一个不重新启动的交换机。为了解决这个问题，安装了一个发电机，但缺乏方便切换的设备，因此需要电工手动进行切换。此外，服务器房的环境在电源中断期间大部分都停电，导致需要一段时间才能使发电机开启并恢复正常运行。最终的解决方案是升级为大型UPS，并对服务器房的插座进行键控开关的改造。问题的根源是未经许可在服务器房内使用插线板并插入冰箱，解决办法是移除冰箱并加强服务器房的安全措施。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Power outages are never good, and they're even worse when your facility needs to run 24/7. Now, &lt;strong&gt;Jaroslaw&lt;/strong&gt;'s organization didn't do a great job setting up for round-the-clock, always-on operations. It was the kind of thing where the organization grew, annexed the neighboring building, and kept growing. The result was hundreds of workstations, two separate power lines, two server rooms, three different Internet uplinks, and huge piles of switches responsible for making this network &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which added the problem that after a power outage, nothing came back on exactly &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, either. It always took some time to find the one switch that opted not to reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many years earlier, someone had the bright idea of installing a generator. The hookup offered no easy way to switch over to generator power, and thus required an electrician with keys to the elecrtical boxes to actually make the change. While the servers had small &lt;abbr title="uninterruptible power supplies"&gt;UPS&lt;/abbr&gt;es, enough of the environment went down during a power outage that, by the time they had the generator on and everything powered back up properly, the outage was usually over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it went for years, until someone higher up looked at the problem and freed up the budget to fix things. The generator was replaced, and there was a plan to change the wiring so that it was faster to switch over- but it turned out that would have tripled the budget and shut the facility down for days while electricians redid the whole electrical system. Instead, the budget was used to upgrade from small, consumer-grade UPSes to a big hocking, 10kW unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the size of a large refrigerator, and had enough power to keep all the critical elements of the facility powered on for twenty hours- time enough to switch over to the generator, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, miracle of miracles, &lt;em&gt;they tested their switchover plan&lt;/em&gt;. They cut main power, saw the UPS come on, ensured work could continue, then had the electricians switch on the generator, and then reversed the whole process. It went off without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then a week later, the UPS screamed about an overload. It lasted for about 40 seconds, then cleared up. Considering that the UPS had way more capacity than they needed, that seemed like a serious problem. Two hours later, it happened again. And again. And again. Jaroslaw went through everything in the server room, trying to find the badly behaved device. At one point, he found an unplugged electric kettle sitting not far from the server room, and went on a hunt to see if anyone had been making tea in the server room, thinking that was the culprit. No one had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over three days, after checking all the equipment, Jaroslaw went to the building wiring diagram and started checking every outlet. He found one, hidden in the back of the server room, ostensibly unused, that had an extension cord plugged in. The cord was neatly tucked into the cable chase, as if it was part of the plan. Jaroslaw tracked the cable, and followed it around the room until he found a hidden refrigerator. Some of the 24/7 staff wanted easy access to snacks and drinks, and didn't want to constantly badge in and out of the server room to get them. While there were plenty of non-UPS protected outlets they could have used, someone had decided &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; was a better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, while Jaroslaw was looking at the fridge, he heard the compressor kick on, and the UPS scream about an overload at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immediate fix was easy: remove the fridge and extension cord, and have a serious discussion about proper server room safety. The longer term fix was spending the last bits of the budget to add keyed switches to all of the outlets in the server room, ensuring no one could plug things in without going through the proper channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;逆问题&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;先验知识&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;算法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可读性&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI建设&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;逆问题及其挑战：逆问题是指从有噪声或有限测量的数据中恢复原始信号的问题，但存在多个可能的原始信号解，这是逆问题的数学特征。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;先验知识的重要性：逆问题的求解需要对不同原始信号的可能性进行评估，而很多情况下无法从已训练的算法中获取这些先验知识。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可读性的方法：通过运用优雅的数学方法，可以训练逆问题求解器，并获取求解器对于不同原始信号的先验概率，从而提高可读性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对算法可读性的意义：这一方法不仅对于训练模型的人员有价值，也提醒我们当前算法的不可读性只是目前技术构建过程中的副作用，不是问题本身固有的属性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI建设的前景：对于从头开始训练模型的人们来说，这是一个值得探索的新方法，但也提醒我们在法规和实践框架上构建的假设，即任何强大的人工智能都必须是不可读的黑匣子，可能会变得过时。AI建设的未来很可能不仅更强大，而且更透明和更易理解。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这篇文章介绍了逆问题的背景和挑战，强调了先验知识对于逆问题求解的重要性。文章提出了一种优雅的数学方法，可以通过训练逆问题求解器来获得对不同原始信号的先验概率，从而提高算法的可读性。作者指出，当前算法的不可读性只是技术构建过程中的副作用，并预示着AI建设的未来将是更透明和更易理解的。这一方法有望在未来的模型训练中得到更多的应用，并对AI建设带来积极的影响。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The paper:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14344"&gt;What&amp;#8217;s in a Prior? Learned Proximal Networks for Inverse Problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it does:&lt;/b&gt; This will be clearer with a bit of context, and step by step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many algorithmic problems belong to the category of &lt;i&gt;inverse problems&lt;/i&gt;: You have a noisy or limited measurement (e.g. a blurry photograph) of a more interesting original source (somebody&amp;#8217;s face), and you want to recover the original source from the noisy version. This is a classic &lt;i&gt;CSI&lt;/i&gt; problem, but pretty much &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; measurement, sensor, or survey can be looked at in this way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basic problem is that there&amp;#8217;s always more than one possible original source for any corrupted version. For example, a sound recording of Beethoven&amp;#8217;s Fifth with plenty of static could be a corrupted version of a clean recording, or it could be a perfect recording of an experimental version of the symphony with added static noise, This might seem facetious, but it&amp;#8217;s a fundamental mathematical feature of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Every&lt;/i&gt; solver for an inverse problem, then, needs some sort of understanding of what cases of original sources are more likely than others. When these expectations &amp;mdash; this &lt;i&gt;prior&lt;/i&gt; &amp;mdash; matches reality well then the solver will work well. If not, if you are trying to use a normal denoiser to clean up your experimental noisecore songs, it&amp;#8217;ll actually make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem is that for most inverse problem solvers &lt;i&gt;you can&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;read&amp;#8221; those assumptions from your trained algorithm&lt;/i&gt;. Let&amp;#8217;s say you train a de-blurring algorithm for your image sensors with a combination of a large data set and some regularization term in the loss function. Even with this full knowledge of everything that went into building the algorithm, there&amp;#8217;s no direct way to figure out if the algorithm thinks &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; that straight lines are more common than curved lines (and will therefore tend to &amp;#8220;fix&amp;#8221; slightly curved lines) or if it thinks that most people have blue eyes and &amp;#8220;correct&amp;#8221; eye color in photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In short &amp;mdash; too late &amp;mdash; the paper uses some very elegant mathematics to figure out a way to train solvers for inverse problems that &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; let you ask how the &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; probability of some original source compares to another. In other words, they come with &lt;i&gt;readable assumptions about the world&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That was a lot for a quick link. Why does it matter?&lt;/b&gt; It&amp;#8217;s a neat technique that&amp;#8217;s worth exploring by anybody training models from scratch &amp;mdash; I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure we&amp;#8217;ll see quite a bit of that in the next years &amp;mdash; but it&amp;#8217;s also a good strategic reminder that the opacity of contemporary models is a technical side effect of how we build them, not something inherent in the problem itself. Regulatory and practice frameworks built upon the assumption that any sufficiently powerful AI will have to be an unreadable black box might become obsolete sooner rather than later. Truth is, we&amp;#8217;ve just started to figure out this style of software building, and our hardware, data, enthusiasm, and money outpace our experience and understanding. This won&amp;#8217;t last forever. The future of AI building is likely to be not just more powerful but also more transparent and better understood. The unreadable complexity of our models isn&amp;#8217;t a sign of sophistication but a reminder of their still experimental nature. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CSS-Only Reading Progress Bar</title>
      <link>https://www.amitmerchant.com/css-only-reading-progress-bar/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;构建、阅读进度条、纯CSS、animation-timeline、演示、浏览器兼容性  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;简介&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript常被用于构建阅读进度条&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文介绍纯CSS构建阅读进度条的方法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;animation-timeline属性&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;animation-timeline属性可以控制CSS动画的进度&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;使用animation-timeline属性构建阅读进度条&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;阅读进度条的HTML结构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;使用div元素作为进度条的容器&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;将容器固定在视口顶部，使进度条始终可见&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;进度条样式设置&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;设置进度条容器为固定到视口顶部，调整其背景颜色&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;设置进度条宽度为100%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;进度条动画设置&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为进度条设置不同的背景颜色，并设定高度为7px&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;使用animation-name属性设置动画名称为width，通过宽度从0到100%的动画实现进度条的动画效果&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;使用animation-timeline属性将动画与视口的垂直滚动位置绑定，实现进度条随着用户滚动页面而动画&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;演示&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;提供一个在CodePen上的演示链接&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;演示中展示了基于纯CSS的阅读进度条效果&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;浏览器兼容性&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;animation-timeline属性目前仍处于实验阶段，不是所有浏览器都支持&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可以检查浏览器兼容性，并根据情况选择使用该属性的方式&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文章介绍了如何使用纯CSS构建阅读进度条，通过使用animation-timeline属性控制CSS动画的进度。具体方法是定义一个固定在视口顶部的包含进度条的容器，给容器和进度条设置样式，并使用animation-name属性和animation-timeline属性实现动画效果。作者还提供了一个在CodePen上的演示链接来展示效果。然而，应注意到animation-timeline属性仍处于实验阶段，不是所有浏览器都支持该属性。可以根据浏览器兼容性的要求来选择是否使用该属性。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;To build a reading progress bar, the one that shows the progress of the user reading the article as they scroll down, it’s hard to not think about JavaScript. But, it turns out, you can &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joshnuss/status/1721322733131207118"&gt;build a reading progress bar using pure CSS&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="markdown-toc"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/css-only-reading-progress-bar/#the-animation-timeline-property" id="markdown-toc-the-animation-timeline-property"&gt;The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;animation-timeline&lt;/code&gt; property&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/css-only-reading-progress-bar/#the-demo" id="markdown-toc-the-demo"&gt;The demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/css-only-reading-progress-bar/#in-closing" id="markdown-toc-in-closing"&gt;In closing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-animation-timeline-property"&gt;The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;animation-timeline&lt;/code&gt; property&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, a new experimental CSS property called &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline"&gt;animation-timeline&lt;/a&gt; lets you specify the timeline that is used to control the progress of a CSS animation. And this is what we’re going to use to build our reading progress bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, we need to define a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element that will act as a progress bar. We will wrap this &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; using a container which will be fixed to the top of the viewport. This will ensure that the progress bar is always visible to the user as they scroll down the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"progress-bar-container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"progress-bar"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"content"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- content goes here --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will define the styles for the progress bar. We will set the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;progress-bar-container&lt;/code&gt; to be fixed to the top of the viewport and adjust its background color which will always be visible to the user. We will also set the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;progress-bar&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;100%&lt;/code&gt; wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.progress-bar-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#6c2fa2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to animate the progress bar, we will use a different background color for &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;progress-bar&lt;/code&gt; and set its height to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;7px&lt;/code&gt;. We will also set the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;animation-name&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; which essentially animates the width of the progress bar from &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;100%&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will set the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;animation-timeline&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;scroll(y)&lt;/code&gt; which ties the animation timeline to the vertical scroll position of the viewport. This will ensure that the progress bar animates as the user scrolls down the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.progress-bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;7px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#e131ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* animation timeline is tied to vertical scroll position */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;animation-timeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;scroll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it! You can see it in action below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;animation-timeline&lt;/code&gt; property is still in the experimental phase, it’s &lt;strong&gt;not supported&lt;/strong&gt; by all the browsers (&lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Safari&lt;/strong&gt; to be precise) yet.&lt;/p&gt;

Plus, practical starting steps for the uninitiated!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Evil Martians team members from various disciplines have tried to make friends with Midjourney: frontend and backend engineers, product designers, and even some of our colleagues who would otherwise never touch it. We've used it to try and complete one of our regular image creation tasks. So, did it work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;a href="https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/midjourney-vs-human-illustrators-ii-more-martians-join-the-battle"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</description>

      <title>Prioritizing Employee Liquidity at Replit</title>
      <link>https://blog.replit.com/prioritizing-employee-liquidity</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor's advice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term knowledge compounding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity for employees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a team with a long-term approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craft Ventures joining the team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;熟悉的导师建议并不一定适用于每个人，长期累积知识才是有效的方法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;给员工提供流动性可以帮助他们稳定生活，同时允许他们采取长期的知识累积方法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;团队应该致力于员工的长期发展，而不是盲目追求风险集中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;重视员工的需求，将他们的利益放在第一位，在选择投资者时优先考虑那些关心建立长期关系的人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craft Ventures的加入将为团队提供更多的价值和支持。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文章讨论了导师建议和长期累积知识的有效性。它强调了给员工提供流动性的重要性，以帮助他们稳定生活，并允许他们采取长期的知识累积方法。文章还强调了建立一个长期发展导向的团队，并重视员工利益和需求的重要性。最后，Craft Ventures的加入被认为是团队的重要一步，将为团队带来更多价值和支持。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Early in my career, a mentor shared the following. "For the next two years, you should join the highest profile startup you can, ignore everything else in your life, and work your ass off. After two years, quit, then go do it again. Do that as many times as you can so you get stock in as many start-ups as possible. Hopefully one of your lottery tickets hits so you can stop grinding and eventually live the life you want".  I stayed at my first company for 11 years, during which I came to question the conventional wisdom. Indexing makes sense as an investment strategy, but I'm not sure it is the best approach if you want to solve a worthwhile problem, understand something deeply, or build something of quality that lasts. For this, a better approach is to focus and compound knowledge over a long period of time. Perhaps it was confirmation bias, but as I looked around at the companies I admired, I saw a pattern. As Steve Jobs reportedly said, “if you look closely, most overnight successes take a very long time”.  There is an obvious counter to this. Most startups fail. Does long term knowledge compounding meaningfully change the odds to the point where it makes up for the risk concentration? For every celebrated long term success story, there are 1,000 obscure failures. How do you build a team that takes the long term approach to knowledge compounding, without encouraging reckless risk concentration?  Replit just completed our first ever tender offer, through which current and former employees could get liquidity for their vested shares. Several Replit Employees told me in private this allowed them to pay off debt, buy a house, or look after their loved ones in a way that made a significant difference in their lives. Unlike my mentor’s advice, they were no longer worried about stacking up lottery tickets in the hope they could one day live the life they wanted. It allowed them to take a long term approach, without signing up for the delayed living plan.  As long as I am here, and market conditions allow, we will fight to get employees liquidity on a regular basis. This is a high conviction bet that long term knowledge compounding wins. We are building the team with this in mind. If this resonates with you, come work here.  What about liquidity for investors? We’ve been lucky to work with investors who also believe the alpha from long term knowledge compounding, which benefits all of us, comes primarily from the operating team, the employees grinding everyday to improve the product and delight customers. Accordingly we will look after the needs of employees first. When evaluating investors, we will prioritize those who care about building long term relationships, ideally who were previously founders or operators themselves. To this point, one of the best operator focused VCs out there made this tender happen. Craft Ventures will be joining the team. Craft brings a deep bench of SaaS and product-led growth expertise. Several members of my team had previously worked with Craft and had strong conviction in their ability to add value to our business. Not only is Craft bought into our vision to empower the next billion software creators, they’re already hard at work helping us achieve it. We are thrilled to have them, and grateful for their partnership.  Now, back to building.</description>

      <title>AI hiring filters don’t optimize what you think they do</title>
      <link>https://blog.rinesi.com/2023/11/ai-hiring-filters-dont-optimize-what-you-think-they-do/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词&lt;/strong&gt;：招聘过滤器，相关特征，偏见，可操纵特征，面试AI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;招聘算法的输出与性能相关特征、不相关特征和可操纵特征有关&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不相关特征（如性别、种族、年龄等）会影响招聘和晋升模式，违法且有损招聘绩效&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可操纵特征（如语言模式、简历格式等）会干扰面试AI，但并不真正关联业绩能力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可操纵特征更多的是表明求职者愿意投入时间和精力来应对与绩效无关的事情&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当面试AI重视可操纵特征时，不仅降低了绩效的相对影响，还助长了系统能力而非领域专长的培养&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文指出当前的大型语言模型驱动招聘算法容易受到操纵，而且更注重与绩效无关的可操纵特征，而非相关特征。这导致公司招聘和晋升方向偏离业绩能力，而对善于游戏系统的人更为偏袒。尽管所雇用的人在事业方面可能很成功，但其对整体绩效的影响却降低了。文章还提到AI的发展将导致对公司和招聘过程的更好理解，进而改善候选人的评估方法。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s start with a General Theory of Hiring Filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any filtering algorithm, the output of whatever AI you use to help you select candidates will depend on three independent sets of features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i0.wp.com/blog.rinesi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hr_diagram.png?ssl=1"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3278" height="426" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.rinesi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hr_diagram.png?resize=760%2C426&amp;#038;ssl=1" width="760" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, your algorithm will focus exclusively on &lt;i&gt;features correlated with performance&lt;/i&gt;. This is harder than it looks &amp;mdash; partly for reasons we&amp;#8217;ll touch upon later &amp;mdash; so in practice algorithms are trained to replicate existing hiring patterns and therefore their performance. The key problem of hiring isn&amp;#8217;t that it is expensive but rather that it&amp;#8217;s difficult to get right. Even organizations like NFL and NBA teams, with lots of resources, data, and clear performance metrics, get draft choices wrong surprisingly often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Non-gameable uncorrelated features&lt;/i&gt; is another way of saying &lt;i&gt;bias&lt;/i&gt;. Features like gender, race, age, body type, mobility handicaps, etc, are usually entirely unrelated to job performance yet have strong impact on hiring and promotion patterns. Whether in AI models or more manual filtering processes, this is very illegal, quite immoral, and rather destructive to hiring performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;i&gt;gameable&lt;/i&gt; features uncorrelated with performance? Those are very seldom discussed because many organizations think of them as &lt;i&gt;correlated&lt;/i&gt; with performance. Think about things like speech patterns, dress codes, or, closer to usual (for now) AI filters, CV formatting and word choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s look at that last one. Many hiring filters, automated and otherwise, will reject or at least disfavor people with badly formatted CVs; &amp;#8220;how to format your CV&amp;#8221; is a staple of job-seeking advice, even in jobs where formatting documents is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a key activity (and even where it is, it&amp;#8217;s eminently easier to train than other factors people aren&amp;#8217;t rejected for early in the process). The usual argument to do this is that it shows consciousness and orientation to detail; this would be somewhat defensible if not for the fact that it&amp;#8217;s much much easier to pretend to be detail-oriented while formatting your CV than it is while learning a complex skill. To put it in another way, &lt;i&gt;the way somebody with a PhD has formatted their CV has zero informational content about their orientation to detail or any other cognitive skill once you factor in that they have a PhD&lt;/i&gt;. The same, at a smaller but still sufficient scale, can be said of other skills that take less time and effort but are still much more demanding than getting the right CV format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gameable non-correlated features do convey information about is the candidate&amp;#8217;s willingness to, well, dedicate time and energy to game features not correlated with performance. This is a measure of how much the person wants the job &amp;mdash; useful information, to be sure, for companies to negotiate wages and conditions with &amp;mdash; and, critically, can be highly predictive of on-the-job success &lt;i&gt;in the sense of getting promotions and so on&lt;/i&gt;, but is at best noninformative about their ability in their expertise domain. A distressingly large part of corporate life is getting the right document formatted in the right way with the right phrasing and, often, getting to &amp;#8220;the right conclusion,&amp;#8221; never mind jumping through various hoops that are unrelated to business performance but that serve well your career. This is true in every human organization from armies to prison gangs to governments. That this happens and is a problem is not the point of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that AI filters, in their current large language model-driven implementations, are &lt;i&gt;eminently&lt;/i&gt; gameable in ways uncorrelated with performance. The key term is &lt;i&gt;adversarial attacks&lt;/i&gt;: just as you can make semantically meaningless changes to images to fool classifiers, you can make semantically meaningless (or even detrimental) changes to texts to manipulate HR AIs. This doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be a &amp;#8220;one WEIRD trick to get hired FOR SURE&amp;#8221;; it&amp;#8217;s enough that it&amp;#8217;s generally possible and generally useful, which means that, at the margin, HR AIs don&amp;#8217;t add new features correlated with performance &amp;mdash; they are using the same texts HR experts look at &amp;mdash; and they often fall into &amp;#8220;traditional&amp;#8221; forms of bias, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; do add new and exciting gameable features uncorrelated with performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By definition gameable uncorrelated features favor people who are happy to game them. As a whole, you are lowering the relative impact of work performance and increasing the relative impact of being the sort of person who thrives on figuring out how to play the system rather than ruthlessly focused on domain expertise. You might get both, of course, but you&amp;#8217;re nudging the scales in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad thing is that this lowers future overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; bad thing is that you won&amp;#8217;t notice, because the people you hire will actually, I suspect, do quite well career-wise. The more impact easily-gameable AIs have on career paths, the more useful it is to learn to game them, and the less useful it is to do pretty much anything else. You can get very far in business (as in everything else) with a minimum of competence and a maximum of charm, and building AIs that can be charmed &amp;mdash; and what else is an adversarial attack but a charming gesture that convinces you of something you have no evidence for? &amp;mdash; just adds another angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t the fault of HR departments or AI developers: lacking good authoritative models of work performance &amp;mdash; mostly because most companies&amp;#8217; internal models are rather bad, particularly for strategic and intellectual work, and I&amp;#8217;m not blaming anybody: it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; hard &amp;mdash;  there&amp;#8217;s always a temptation to do a thing because we have to do something and it is a something, not because we have strong &lt;i&gt;ex ante&lt;/i&gt; reasons  to believe it&amp;#8217;ll work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core this is an intellectual problem. Our hiring AIs have the performance they have because our understanding of on-the-job performance is what it is. It&amp;#8217;s not &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;, but it bounds what we can do with AIs. Properly speaking, the role of HR overlaps strongly with every operational model and measure: what else is HR but understanding how to best help people do what they do, and how can HR experts do that without a detailed understanding of what it is they do? How can we get AI-level hiring performance without AI-level models of work activities, which ultimately mean AI-level models of companies as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully expect AI to revolutionize HR, not because of what it&amp;#8217;ll help automate &amp;mdash; as I said above, I believe at this point it&amp;#8217;ll just make things worse even if they look better under legacy metrics &amp;mdash; but because of what it&amp;#8217;ll help &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt;. A revolution in the self-understanding of companies, which will be impossible without the integration of expertise from HR, AI designers, PM experts, and a long, long list of other domain experts, while difficult and expensive at first, will profoundly change the way candidates are evaluated. This time for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;噩梦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;软件和算法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;病人和生理指标&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;面对自己的责任&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;消除噩梦的解决方案&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;介绍：对话开始，描述主人公经历噩梦和心理压力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;软件和算法的影响：主人公描述了他对软件和算法的工作方式和责任的不确定性&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;病人和生理指标：主人公提到了他对病人的关系以及他所工作的设备的作用的疑虑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;面对自己的责任：主人公与心理治疗师讨论了他对病人的影响和责任的感受&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;消除噩梦的解决方案：心理治疗师建议主人公改变工作方式以减轻噩梦和心理压力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这篇文章讲述了一个生物工程师在工作中经历噩梦和心理压力的故事。他对软件和算法的工作方式和对病人的关系感到不确定，并对自己的责任感到困惑。最后，心理治疗师建议他改变工作方式以减轻噩梦和心理压力。这个故事引发了对技术和人类责任的思考。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bioengineer cleared his throat, looked at nowhere, and said &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m having nightmares again.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist nodded. &amp;#8220;Still dreaming of crashing physiological metrics?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No. Yes. I still see the lines, as if I were in a monitoring interface. I know what they mean. Even when they move in patterns I&amp;#8217;ve never seen, patterns I know are biologically impossible, I can understand them.&amp;#8221; A pause. &amp;#8220;There are screams too.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s new. You don&amp;#8217;t hear anything when you&amp;#8217;re working.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No, of course not. I&amp;#8217;m not in the room. I don&amp;#8217;t know their names or their faces, just their medical profiles. I don&amp;#8217;t even do anything. I just monitor the software and adjust algorithm parameters. I don&amp;#8217;t do anything.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ever thought you heard a scream during a session? Even if you didn&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;d be really bad.&amp;#8221; A forced chuckle. &amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist didn&amp;#8217;t comment on it. &amp;#8220;You said twice that you don&amp;#8217;t do anything during the sessions. Is that how you feel? You are a highly trained specialist after all.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You know what I mean. I do algorithm programming and some online adjustments. I don&amp;#8217;t control the effectors in the device. That&amp;#8217;s what the software is for.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So what happens is the software&amp;#8217;s fault?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s the fault of the people in the device?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Maybe, yes. The algorithm doesn&amp;#8217;t activate any effectors as long as the subject is truthful. And it&amp;#8217;s designed to adjust dynamically to optimize response modification. It&amp;#8217;s about maximizing effectiveness, not&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Not pain.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yes. That. I don&amp;#8217;t enjoy hurting subjects.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But you don&amp;#8217;t, right? It&amp;#8217;s the software, and in some sense the people itself.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I guess. Is that what you think?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m your therapist. I&amp;#8217;m not trained in bioengineering, algorithm development, or, for that matter, ethical theory. What I optimize for is your well-being and capability to perform your duties safely and effectively.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And what&amp;#8217;s the verdict?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist made an unnecessary pause. &amp;#8220;Bleedback from data analysis to empathy isn&amp;#8217;t uncommon, but it&amp;#8217;s nonetheless concerning for your own sake and for your long-term performance. I&amp;#8217;ll make a recommendation that you move back from on-site algorithm supervision to offline design. It was due next month anyway.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For almost everybody, yes. We&amp;#8217;re closing down beta-testing and moving ahead to fully automated interrogation setups. No algorithm designer anywhere in most locations.&amp;#8221; The bioengineer smiled thinly. &amp;#8220;Maybe that&amp;#8217;ll stop the dreams.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist matched his smile. &amp;#8220;I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised,&amp;#8221; he said, and made a quick annotation on his notepad, although as an artificial VR software agent it didn&amp;#8217;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Post Mortem on Cloudflare Control Plane and Analytics Outage</title>
      <link>http://blog.cloudflare.com/post-mortem-on-cloudflare-control-plane-and-analytics-outage/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning on Thursday, November 2, 2023 at 11:43 UTC Cloudflare's control plane and analytics services experienced an outage. The control plane of Cloudflare consists primarily of the customer-facing interface for all of our services including our website and APIs. Our analytics services include logging and analytics reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident lasted from November 2 at 11:44 UTC until November 4 at 04:25 UTC. We were able to restore most of our control plane at our disaster recovery facility as of November 2 at 17:57 UTC. Many customers would not have experienced issues with most of our products after the disaster recovery facility came online. However, other services took longer to restore and customers that used them may have seen issues until we fully resolved the incident. Our raw log services were unavailable for most customers for the duration of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services have now been restored for all customers. Throughout the incident, Cloudflare's network and security services continued to work as expected. While there were periods where customers were unable to make changes to those services, traffic through our network was not impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post outlines the events that caused this incident, the architecture we had in place to prevent issues like this, what failed, what worked and why, and the changes we're making based on what we've learned over the last 36 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, this never should have happened. We believed that we had high availability systems in place that should have stopped an outage like this, even when one of our core data center providers failed catastrophically. And, while many systems did remain online as designed, some critical systems had non-obvious dependencies that made them unavailable. I am sorry and embarrassed for this incident and the pain that it caused our customers and our team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="intended-design"&gt;Intended Design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's control plane and analytics systems run primarily on servers in three data centers around Hillsboro, Oregon. The three data centers are independent of one another, each have multiple utility power feeds, and each have multiple redundant and independent network connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facilities were intentionally chosen to be at a distance apart that would minimize the chances that a natural disaster would cause all three to be impacted, while still close enough that they could all run active-active redundant data clusters. This means that they are continuously syncing data between the three facilities. By design, if any of the facilities goes offline then the remaining ones are able to continue to operate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a system design that we began implementing four years ago. While most of our critical control plane systems had been migrated to the high availability cluster, some services, especially for some newer products, had not yet been added to the high availability cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, our logging systems were intentionally not part of the high availability cluster. The logic of that decision was that logging was already a distributed problem where logs were queued at the edge of our network and then sent back to the core in Oregon (or another regional facility for customers using regional services for logging). If our logging facility was offline then analytics logs would queue at the edge of our network until it came back online. We determined that analytics being delayed was acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="flexential-data-center-power-failure"&gt;Flexential Data Center Power Failure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest of the three facilities in Oregon is run by Flexential. We refer to this facility as “PDX-04.” Cloudflare leases space in PDX-04 where we house our largest analytics cluster as well as more than a third of the machines for our high availability cluster. It is also the default location for services that have not yet been onboarded onto our high availability cluster. We are a relatively large customer of the facility, consuming approximately 10 percent of its total capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="1045" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/11/Flexential-Electrical-System.jpg" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 2 at 08:50 UTC Portland General Electric (PGE), the utility company that services PDX-04, had an unplanned maintenance event affecting one of their independent power feeds into the building. That event shut down one feed into PDX-04. The data center has multiple feeds with some level of independence that can power the facility. However, Flexential powered up their generators to effectively supplement the feed that was down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counter to best practices, Flexential did not inform Cloudflare that they had failed over to generator power. None of our observability tools were able to detect that the source of power had changed. Had they informed us, we would have stood up a team to monitor the facility closely and move control plane services that were dependent on that facility out while it was degraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also unusual that Flexential ran both the one remaining utility feed and the generators at the same time. It is not unusual for utilities to ask data centers to drop off the grid when power demands are high and run exclusively on generators. Flexential operates 10 generators, inclusive of redundant units, capable of supporting the facility at full load. It would also have been possible for Flexential to run the facility only from the remaining utility feed. We haven't gotten a clear answer why they ran utility power and generator power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="informed-speculation-on-what-happened-next"&gt;Informed Speculation On What Happened Next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this decision onward, we don't yet have clarity from Flexential on the root cause or some of the decisions they made or the events. We will update this post as we get more information from Flexential, as well as PGE, on what happened. Some of what follows is informed speculation based on the most likely series of events as well as what individual Flexential employees have shared with us unofficially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible reason they may have left the utility line running is because Flexential was part of a program with PGE called DSG. DSG allows the local utility to run a data center's generators to help supply additional power to the grid. In exchange, the power company helps maintain the generators and supplies fuel. We have been unable to locate any record of Flexential informing us about the DSG program. We've asked if DSG was active at the time and have not received an answer. We do not know if it contributed to the decisions that Flexential made, but it could explain why the utility line continued to remain online after the generators were started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At approximately 11:40 UTC, there was a ground fault on a PGE transformer at PDX-04. We believe, but have not been able to get confirmation from Flexential or PGE, that this was the transformer that stepped down power from the grid for the second feed that was still running as it entered the data center. It seems likely, though we have not been able to confirm with Flexential or PGE, that the ground fault was caused by the unplanned maintenance PGE was performing that impacted the first feed. Or it was a very unlucky coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ground faults with high voltage (12,470 volt) power lines are very bad. Electrical systems are designed to quickly shut down to prevent damage when one occurs. Unfortunately, in this case, the protective measure also shut down all of PDX-04’s generators. This meant that the two sources of power generation for the facility — both the redundant utility lines as well as the 10 generators — were offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in addition to the generators, PDX-04 also contains a bank of UPS batteries. These batteries are supposedly sufficient to power the facility for approximately 10 minutes. That time is meant to be enough to bridge the gap between the power going out and the generators automatically starting up. If Flexential could get the generators or a utility feed restored within 10 minutes then there would be no interruption. In reality, the batteries started to fail after only 4 minutes based on what we observed from our own equipment failing. And it took Flexential far longer than 10 minutes to get the generators restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="attempting-to-restore-power"&gt;Attempting to Restore Power&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we haven't gotten official confirmation, we have been told by employees that three things hampered getting the generators back online. First, they needed to be physically accessed and manually restarted because of the way the ground fault had tripped circuits. Second, Flexential's access control system was not powered by the battery backups so it was offline. And third, the overnight staffing at the site did not include an experienced operations or electrical expert — the overnight shift consisted of security and an unaccompanied technician who had only been on the job for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 11:44 and 12:01 UTC, with the generators not fully restarted, the UPS batteries ran out of power and all customers of the data center lost power. Throughout this, Flexential never informed Cloudflare that there was any issue at the facility. We were first notified of issues in the data center when the two routers that connect the facility to the rest of the world went offline at 11:44 UTC. When we weren't able to reach the routers directly or through out-of-band management, we attempted to contact Flexential and dispatched our local team to physically travel to the facility. The first message to us from Flexential that they were experiencing an issue was at 12:28 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are currently experiencing an issue with power at our [PDX-04] that began at approximately 0500AM PT [12:00 UTC]. Engineers are actively working to resolve the issue and restore service. We will communicate progress every 30 minutes or as more information becomes available as to the estimated time to restore. Thank you for your patience and understanding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 id="designing-for-data-center-level-failure"&gt;Designing for Data Center Level Failure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the PDX-04’s design was certified Tier III before construction and is expected to provide high availability SLAs, we planned for the possibility that it could go offline. Even well-run facilities can have bad days. And we planned for that. What we expected would happen in that case is that our analytics would be offline, logs would be queued at the edge and delayed, and certain lower priority services that were not integrated into our high availability cluster would go offline temporarily until they could be restored at another facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other two data centers running in the area would take over responsibility for the high availability cluster and keep critical services online. Generally that worked as planned. Unfortunately, we discovered that a subset of services that were supposed to be on the high availability cluster had dependencies on services exclusively running in PDX-04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, two critical services that process logs and power our analytics — Kafka and ClickHouse — were only available in PDX-04 but had services that depended on them that were running in the high availability cluster. Those dependencies shouldn’t have been so tight, should have failed more gracefully, and we should have caught them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had performed testing of our high availability cluster by taking offline each (and both) of the other two data center facilities entirely offline. And we had also tested taking the high availability portion of PDX-04 offline. However, we had never tested fully taking the entire PDX-04 facility offline. As a result, we had missed the importance of some of these dependencies on our data plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were also far too lax about requiring new products and their associated databases to integrate with the high availability cluster. Cloudflare allows multiple teams to innovate quickly. As such, products often take different paths toward their initial alpha. While, over time, our practice is to migrate the backend for these services to our best practices, we did not formally require that before products were declared generally available (GA). That was a mistake as it meant that the redundancy protections we had in place worked inconsistently depending on the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, far too many of our services depend on the availability of our core facilities. While this is the way a lot of software services are created, it does not play to Cloudflare’s strength. We are good at distributed systems. Throughout this incident, our global network continued to perform as expected. While some of our products and features are configurable and serviceable through the edge of our network without needing the core, far too many today fail if the core is unavailable. We need to use the distributed systems products that we make available to all our customers for all our services so they continue to function mostly as normal even if our core facilities are disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="disaster-recovery"&gt;Disaster Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 12:48 UTC, Flexential was able to get the generators restarted. Power returned to portions of the facility. In order to not overwhelm the system, when power is restored to a data center it is typically done gradually by powering back on one circuit at a time. Like the circuit breakers in a residential home, each customer is serviced by redundant breakers. When Flexential attempted to power back up Cloudflare's circuits, the circuit breakers were discovered to be faulty. We don't know if the breakers failed due to the ground fault or some other surge as a result of the incident, or if they'd been bad before and it was only discovered after they had been powered off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexential began the process of replacing the failed breakers. That required them to source new breakers because more were bad than they had on hand in the facility. Because more services were offline than we expected, and because Flexential could not give us a time for restoration of our services, we made the call at 13:40 UTC to fail over to Cloudflare's disaster recovery sites located in Europe. Thankfully, we only needed to fail over a small percentage of Cloudflare’s overall control plane. Most of our services continued to run across our high availability systems across the two active core data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We turned up the first services on the disaster recovery site at 13:43 UTC.Cloudflare's disaster recovery sites provide critical control plane services in the event of a disaster. While the disaster recovery site does not support some of our log processing services, it is designed to support the other portions of our control plane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When services were turned up there, we experienced a thundering herd problem where the API calls that had been failing overwhelmed our services. We implemented rate limits to get the request volume under control. During this period, customers of most products would have seen intermittent errors when making modifications through our dashboard or API. By 17:57 UTC, the services that had been successfully moved to the disaster recovery site were stable and most customers were no longer directly impacted. However, some systems still required manual configuration (e.g., Magic WAN) and some other services, largely related to log processing and some bespoke APIs, remained unavailable until we were able to restore PDX-04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="some-products-and-features-delayed-restart"&gt;Some Products and Features Delayed Restart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of products did not properly get stood up on our disaster recovery sites. These tended to be newer products where we had not fully implemented and tested a disaster recovery procedure. These included our Stream service for uploading new videos and some other services. Our team worked two simultaneous tracks to get these services restored: 1) reimplementing them on our disaster recovery sites; and 2) migrating them to our high-availability cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexential replaced our failed circuit breakers, restored both utility feeds, and confirmed clean power at 22:48 UTC. Our team was all-hands-on-deck and had worked all day on the emergency, so I made the call that most of us should get some rest and start the move back to PDX-04 in the morning. That decision delayed our full recovery, but I believe made it less likely that we’d compound this situation with additional mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning first thing on November 3, our team began restoring service in PDX-04. That began with physically booting our network gear then powering up thousands of servers and restoring their services. The state of our services in the data center was unknown as we believed multiple power cycles were likely to have occurred during the incident. Our only safe process to recover was to follow a complete bootstrap of the entire facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This involved a manual process of bringing our configuration management servers online to begin the restoration of the facility. Rebuilding these took 3 hours. From there, our team was able to bootstrap the rebuild of the rest of the servers that power our services. Each server took between 10 minutes and 2 hours to rebuild. While we were able to run this in parallel across multiple servers, there were inherent dependencies between services that required some to be brought back online in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services are now fully restored as of November 4 at 04:25 UTC. For most customers, because of how we queue analytics at the edge, you should see no data loss in your analytics. Any gaps that appear as of now we expect will fill in as any lingering caches of analytics data is ingested. For customers that use our log push feature, your logs will not have been processed for the majority of the event, so anything you did not receive will not be recovered. However, the records in our analytics dashboard will still be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="lessons-and-remediation"&gt;Lessons and Remediation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a number of questions that we need answered from Flexential. But we also must expect that entire data centers may fail. Google has a process where when there’s a significant event or crisis they can call a Code Yellow or Code Red. In these cases, most or all engineering resources are shifted to addressing the issue at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have not had such a process in the past, but it’s clear today we need to implement a version of it ourselves: Code Orange. We are shifting all non-critical engineering functions to focusing on ensuring high reliability of our control plane. As part of that, we expect the following changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove dependencies on our core data centers for control plane configuration of all services and move them wherever possible to be powered first by our distributed network&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the control plane running on the network continues to function even if all our core data centers are offline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Require that all products and features that are designated Generally Available must rely on the high availability cluster (if they rely on any of our core data centers), without having any software dependencies on specific facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Require all products and features that are designated Generally Available have a reliable disaster recovery plan that is tested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test the blast radius of system failures and minimize the number of services that are impacted by a failure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement more rigorous chaos testing of all data center functions including the full removal of each of our core data center facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thorough auditing of all core data centers and a plan to reaudit to ensure they comply with our standards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logging and analytics disaster recovery plan that ensures no logs are dropped even in the case of a failure of all our core facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, I am sorry and embarrassed for this incident and the pain that it caused our customers and our team. We have the right systems and procedures in place to be able to withstand even the cascading string of failures we saw at our data center provider, but we need to be more rigorous about enforcing that they are followed and tested for unknown dependencies. This will have my full attention and the attention of a large portion of our team through the balance of the year. And the pain from the last couple days will make us better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Qualified certificates with qualified risks</title>
      <link>http://security.googleblog.com/2023/11/qualified-certificates-with-qualified.html</link>
      <description>&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Chrome Security team&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Improving the interoperability of web services is an important and worthy goal. We believe that it should be easier for people to maintain and control their digital identities. And we appreciate that policymakers working on European Union digital certificate legislation, known as eIDAS, are working toward this goal. However, a specific part of the legislation, Article 45, hinders browsers’ ability to enforce certain security requirements on certificates, potentially holding back advances in web security for decades. We and many past and present leaders in the international web community have significant concerns about Article 45's impact on security. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We urge lawmakers to heed the &lt;a href="https://eidas-open-letter.org/" target="_blank"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; of scientists and security experts to revise this part of the legislation rather than erode users’ privacy and security on the web.

      <title>Best of both worlds: Achieving scalability and quality in text clustering</title>
      <link>http://blog.research.google/2023/11/best-of-both-worlds-achieving.html</link>
      <description>&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Sara Ahmadian and Mehran Kazemi, Research Scientists, Google Research&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjR2mD5afdT_Qg9Ex4Lj94FaxB9KHiq20iLoDlOY8S8Rk5XsV6n_4dU9CFbCvSeBSONGQYqy-yMGY6-KU_y_RGICOpz76GNdzv7ecxor_rVnF31lZOd3STQF4MIE4F_EadrSI1DXY67MXnsCswY3w3X8vX8KgU_rRPs6eTZndYAbVcEezgwaUsdZEAHD59Z/s320/hero.jpg" style="display: none;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"&gt;Clustering&lt;/a&gt; is a fundamental, ubiquitous problem in data mining and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning"&gt;unsupervised&lt;/a&gt; machine learning, where the goal is to group together similar items. The standard forms of clustering are metric clustering and graph clustering. In metric clustering, a given metric space defines distances between data points, which are grouped together based on their &lt;em&gt;separation&lt;/em&gt;. In graph clustering, a given graph connects similar data points through edges, and the clustering process groups data points together based on the &lt;em&gt;connections&lt;/em&gt; between them. Both clustering forms are particularly useful for large corpora where class labels can’t be defined. Examples of such corpora are the ever-growing digital text collections of various internet platforms, with applications including organizing and searching documents, identifying patterns in text, and recommending relevant documents to users (see more examples in the following posts: &lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2010/10/clustering-related-queries-based-on.html?m=1"&gt;clustering related queries based on user intent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2021/10/practical-differentially-private.html"&gt;practical differentially private clustering&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The choice of text clustering method often presents a dilemma. One approach is to use embedding models, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)"&gt;BERT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692"&gt;RoBERTa&lt;/a&gt;, to define a metric clustering problem. Another is to utilize &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@geetkal67/attention-networks-a-simple-way-to-understand-cross-attention-3b396266d82e"&gt;cross-attention&lt;/a&gt; (CA) models, such as &lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html"&gt;PaLM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer"&gt;GPT&lt;/a&gt;, to define a graph clustering problem. CA models can provide highly accurate similarity scores, but constructing the input graph may require a prohibitive quadratic number of inference calls to the model. On the other hand, a metric space can efficiently be defined by distances of embeddings produced by embedding models. However, these similarity distances are typically of substantial lower-quality compared to the similarity signals of CA models, and hence the produced clustering can be of much lower-quality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;An overview of the embedding-based and cross-attention–based similarity scoring functions and their scalability vs. quality dilemma.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;
Motivated by this, in “&lt;a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=p0JSSa1AuV"&gt;KwikBucks: Correlation Clustering with Cheap-Weak and Expensive-Strong Signals”, presented at ICLR 2023&lt;/a&gt;, we describe a novel clustering algorithm that effectively combines the scalability benefits from embedding models and the quality from CA models. This graph clustering algorithm has query access to both the CA model and the embedding model, however, we apply a budget on the number of queries made to the CA model. This algorithm uses the CA model to answer edge queries, and benefits from unlimited access to similarity scores from the embedding model. We describe how this proposed setting bridges algorithm design and practical considerations, and can be applied to other clustering problems with similar available scoring functions, such as clustering problems on images and media. We demonstrate how this algorithm yields high-quality clusters with almost a linear number of query calls to the CA model. We have also &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/kwikbucks/kwikbucks.zip"&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt; the data used in our experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="line-height: 40%;"&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The clustering algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The KwikBucks algorithm is an extension of the well-known &lt;a href="https://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/Algo2/Note/kwik.pdf"&gt;KwikCluster algorithm (Pivot algorithm)&lt;/a&gt;. The high-level idea is to first select a set of documents (i.e., centers) with no similarity edge between them, and then form clusters around these centers. To obtain the quality from CA models and the runtime efficiency from embedding models, we introduce the novel &lt;em&gt;combo similarity oracle&lt;/em&gt; mechanism. In this approach, we utilize the embedding model to guide the selection of queries to be sent to the CA model. When given a set of center documents and a target document, the combo similarity oracle mechanism outputs a center from the set that is similar to the target document, if present. The combo similarity oracle enables us to save on budget by limiting the number of query calls to the CA model when selecting centers and forming clusters. It does this by first ranking centers based on their embedding similarity to the target document, and then querying the CA model for the pair (i.e., target document and ranked center), as shown below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRaIWRUaPHb_4QFG2wusDoqrVUJkePKRYgLhU992eEUjnI8gpZ2JzIDBdOEb56zHEBammMVEDj_hgejIhCLcmZK5r8ADTVn54ttrOPnOnR2tuk2J8UVIRQoRc_LOHA56_WnQSWPZbB31dZMkj4VI6btb7NkdUOtM1iM1VAKP5t3F-KiBxXySFb4BrYdPmy/s1601/process.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRaIWRUaPHb_4QFG2wusDoqrVUJkePKRYgLhU992eEUjnI8gpZ2JzIDBdOEb56zHEBammMVEDj_hgejIhCLcmZK5r8ADTVn54ttrOPnOnR2tuk2J8UVIRQoRc_LOHA56_WnQSWPZbB31dZMkj4VI6btb7NkdUOtM1iM1VAKP5t3F-KiBxXySFb4BrYdPmy/s16000/process.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A combo similarity oracle that for a set of documents and a target document, returns a similar document from the set, if present.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

 

&lt;p&gt;
We then perform a post processing step to merge clusters if there is a strong connection between two of them, i.e., when the number of connecting edges is higher than the number of missing edges between two clusters. Additionally, we apply the following steps for further computational savings on queries made to the CA model, and to improve performance at runtime:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We leverage &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11557.pdf"&gt;query-efficient correlation clustering&lt;/a&gt; to form a set of centers from a set of randomly selected documents instead of selecting these centers from all the documents (in the illustration below, the center nodes are red).

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We apply the combo similarity oracle mechanism to perform the cluster assignment step in parallel for all non-center documents and leave documents with no similar center as singletons. In the illustration below, the assignments are depicted by blue arrows and initially two (non-center) nodes are left as singletons due to no assignment. 

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the post-processing step, to ensure scalability, we use the embedding similarity scores to filter down the potential mergers (in the illustration below, the green dashed boundaries show these merged clusters).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1bJ65zsG-PYQwvRncviG5befEFPFhA95xoPUB_QV4hQjvz9vNEi-k4_WfZnMG9-25_t6-lpyNCE2MfD_ZSa6q30CjgBF5iRcmH3n6ThprinvD_Qx6rNCIOYuI4ml2U_rI3qI9q6E5qKW9qL1PKAzkOO6wyr8_kS2iDb_FIx2W7Hgjewh5ms2oe0QClfrj/s1322/Kwikbux%20gif.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1bJ65zsG-PYQwvRncviG5befEFPFhA95xoPUB_QV4hQjvz9vNEi-k4_WfZnMG9-25_t6-lpyNCE2MfD_ZSa6q30CjgBF5iRcmH3n6ThprinvD_Qx6rNCIOYuI4ml2U_rI3qI9q6E5qKW9qL1PKAzkOO6wyr8_kS2iDb_FIx2W7Hgjewh5ms2oe0QClfrj/s16000/Kwikbux%20gif.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Illustration of progress of the clustering algorithm on a given graph instance. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




&lt;br /&gt;

  
&lt;div style="line-height: 40%;"&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
We evaluate the novel clustering algorithm on various datasets with different properties using different embedding-based and cross-attention–based models. We compare the clustering algorithm’s performance with the two best performing baselines (see the &lt;a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=p0JSSa1AuV"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; for more details): 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11557.pdf"&gt;query-efficient correlation clustering&lt;/a&gt; algorithm for budgeted clustering with access to CA only.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering"&gt;Spectral clustering&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_graph"&gt;k-nearest neighbor graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (kNN) formed by querying the CA model for the &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-nearest neighbors of each vertex from embedding-based similarity.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To evaluate the quality of clustering, we use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall"&gt;precision and recall&lt;/a&gt;. Precision is used to calculate the percentage of similar pairs out of all co-clustered pairs and recall is the percentage of co-clustered similar pairs out of all similar pairs. To measure the quality of the obtained solutions from our experiments, we use the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score"&gt;F1-score&lt;/a&gt;, which is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean"&gt;harmonic mean&lt;/a&gt; of the precision and recall, where 1.0 is the highest possible value that indicates perfect precision and recall, and 0 is the lowest possible value that indicates if either precision or recall are zero. The table below reports the F1-score for Kwikbucks and various baselines in the case that we allow only a linear number of queries to the CA model. We show that Kwikbucks offers a substantial boost in performance with a 45% relative improvement compared to the best baseline when averaging across all datasets.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQbrQVGenUUG0sSZ_Ofe9xIiJ068UIBcUCEvH2dUEdji1XMElQJM13RQkuZp2XExktKlpY6VGr6QfujDWyvu9kUlYtIFSV7hKYEgz6D-CUF0Q7UPN4p58EJji5HeVgXfLoAAhatmG74b2zUnewtGKkoyPz9NQIbc43cqKZ35vcyMlJ99PaCdzk1X-WFAqr/s1574/results.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQbrQVGenUUG0sSZ_Ofe9xIiJ068UIBcUCEvH2dUEdji1XMElQJM13RQkuZp2XExktKlpY6VGr6QfujDWyvu9kUlYtIFSV7hKYEgz6D-CUF0Q7UPN4p58EJji5HeVgXfLoAAhatmG74b2zUnewtGKkoyPz9NQIbc43cqKZ35vcyMlJ99PaCdzk1X-WFAqr/s16000/results.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Comparing the clustering algorithm to two baseline algorithms using various public datasets: (1) The &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11557.pdf"&gt;query-efficient correlation clustering&lt;/a&gt; algorithm for budgeted clustering with access to CA only, and (2) &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering"&gt;spectral clustering&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_graph"&gt;k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; formed by querying the CA model for the &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-nearest neighbors of each vertex from embedding-based similarity. Pre-processed datasets can be downloaded &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/kwikbucks/kwikbucks.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
The figure below compares the clustering algorithm’s performance with baselines using different query budgets. We observe that KwikBucks consistently outperforms other baselines at various budgets.
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Text clustering often presents a dilemma in the choice of similarity function: embedding models are scalable but lack quality, while cross-attention models offer quality but substantially hurt scalability. We present a clustering algorithm that offers the best of both worlds: the scalability of embedding models and the quality of cross-attention models. KwikBucks can also be applied to other clustering problems with multiple similarity oracles of varying accuracy levels. This is validated with an exhaustive set of experiments on various datasets with diverse properties. See the &lt;a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=p0JSSa1AuV"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

      <title>Zero-shot adaptive prompting of large language models</title>
      <link>http://blog.research.google/2023/11/zero-shot-adaptive-prompting-of-large.html</link>
      <description>&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Xingchen Wan, Student Researcher, and Ruoxi Sun, Research Scientist, Cloud AI Team&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqTosaeIs4AMYukkmgUBEii6iQcrr9_dNKM0cHnW6m9Wi8yX0V-QCduQfkqLyQPNpVbze3OFO-nPG5Wm9DLMM8pEAfhQGq-TEJroLJGQyqNr-hlJNkToBCmgJbphrCRvlv95gkDQH0ScT7VrXu2VCTKyiWy8yYM4G8voF0kD0K2oxwg2M2xBcz1yQnU0Zb/s600/USP.gif" style="display: none;" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) are very promising as reflected in their capability for general problem-solving in &lt;em&gt;few-shot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;zero-shot&lt;/em&gt; setups, even without explicit training on these tasks. This is impressive because in the few-shot setup, LLMs are presented with only a few question-answer demonstrations prior to being given a test question. Even more challenging is the zero-shot setup, where the LLM is directly prompted with the &lt;em&gt;test question only&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even though the few-shot setup has dramatically reduced the amount of data required to adapt a model for a specific use-case, there are still cases where generating sample prompts can be challenging. For example, handcrafting even a small number of demos for the broad range of tasks covered by general-purpose models can be difficult or, for unseen tasks, impossible. For example, for tasks like summarization of long articles or those that require domain knowledge (e.g., medical question answering), it can be challenging to generate sample answers. In such situations, models with high zero-shot performance are useful since no manual prompt generation is required. However, zero-shot performance is typically weaker as the LLM is not presented with guidance and thus is prone to spurious output. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In “&lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.216/"&gt;Better Zero-shot Reasoning with Self-Adaptive Prompting&lt;/a&gt;”, published at &lt;a href="https://2023.aclweb.org/"&gt;ACL 2023&lt;/a&gt;, we propose &lt;em&gt;Consistency-Based Self-Adaptive Prompting (COSP) &lt;/em&gt;to address this dilemma. COSP is a zero-shot automatic prompting method for reasoning problems that carefully selects and constructs &lt;em&gt;pseudo-&lt;/em&gt;demonstrations for LLMs using only unlabeled samples (that are typically easy to obtain) and the models’ own predictions. With COSP, we largely close the performance gap between zero-shot and few-shot while retaining the desirable generality of zero-shot prompting. We follow this with “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14926"&gt;Universal Self-Adaptive Prompting&lt;/a&gt;“ (USP), accepted at &lt;a href="https://2023.emnlp.org/"&gt;EMNLP 2023&lt;/a&gt;, in which we extend the idea to a wide range of &lt;em&gt;general &lt;/em&gt;natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Prompting LLMs with their own outputs&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Knowing that LLMs benefit from demonstrations and have at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; zero-shot abilities, we wondered whether the model’s zero-shot outputs could serve as demonstrations for the model to prompt itself. The challenge is that zero-shot solutions are imperfect, and we risk giving LLMs poor quality demonstrations, which could be worse than no demonstrations at all. Indeed, the figure below shows that adding a correct demonstration to a question can lead to a correct solution of the test question (Demo1 with question), whereas adding an incorrect demonstration (Demo 2 + questions, Demo 3 with questions) leads to incorrect answers.  Therefore, we need to select reliable self-generated demonstrations.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5QShw0e9OdtzA9Ob5vAtWloPZGIZgCGFSL9okO-5pxIN3M2QciE1MOT73NsdaHwOz5LiH94IZRkE0SYSJ2fiiBSNR_qHCrO-URHqZPq7Fhhpvm6wtykLsySfF9l5ERsbOqtT_J1-A8pjoOa9htdvXEnL4-WRbP-Kn85aIz7G-BvWNflcaG4lUPomVlLU8/s1051/image6.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5QShw0e9OdtzA9Ob5vAtWloPZGIZgCGFSL9okO-5pxIN3M2QciE1MOT73NsdaHwOz5LiH94IZRkE0SYSJ2fiiBSNR_qHCrO-URHqZPq7Fhhpvm6wtykLsySfF9l5ERsbOqtT_J1-A8pjoOa9htdvXEnL4-WRbP-Kn85aIz7G-BvWNflcaG4lUPomVlLU8/w472-h640/image6.png" width="472" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;Example inputs &amp;amp; outputs for reasoning tasks, which illustrates the need for carefully designed selection procedure for in-context demonstrations (&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01413"&gt;MultiArith&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;dataset &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311"&gt;PaLM-62B&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;model): (1) zero-shot&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html" style="text-align: left;"&gt;chain-of-thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;with no demo: correct logic but wrong answer; (2) correct demo (Demo1) and correct answer; (3) correct but repetitive demo (Demo2) leads to repetitive outputs; (4) erroneous demo (Demo3) leads to a wrong answer; but (5) combining Demo3 and Demo1 again leads to a correct answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
COSP leverages a key observation of LLMs: that confident and consistent predictions are more likely correct. This observation, of course, depends on how good the uncertainty estimate of the LLM is. Luckily, in large models, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05221"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11610"&gt;works&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the uncertainty estimates are robust. Since measuring confidence requires only model predictions, not labels, we propose to use this as a zero-shot proxy of correctness. The high-confidence outputs and their inputs are then used as &lt;em&gt;pseudo&lt;/em&gt;-demonstrations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this as our starting premise, we estimate the model’s confidence in its output based on its &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171"&gt;self-consistency&lt;/a&gt; and use this measure to select robust self-generated demonstrations. We ask LLMs the same question multiple times with zero-shot &lt;a href="https://blog.research.google/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html"&gt;chain-of-thought&lt;/a&gt; (CoT) prompting. To guide the model to generate a range of possible rationales and final answers, we include randomness controlled by a “temperature” hyperparameter. In an extreme case, if the model is 100% certain, it should output identical final answers each time. We then compute the entropy of the answers to gauge the uncertainty — the answers that have high self-consistency and for which the LLM is more certain, are likely to be correct and will be selected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assuming that w&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; are presented with a collection of unlabeled questions, the COSP method is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input each unlabeled question into an LLM, obtaining multiple rationales and answers by sampling the model multiple times. The most frequent answers are highlighted, followed by a score that measures consistency of answers across multiple sampled outputs (higher is better). In addition to favoring more consistent answers, we also penalize repetition within a response (i.e., with repeated words or phrases) and encourage diversity of selected demonstrations. We encode the preference towards consistent, un-repetitive and diverse outputs in the form of a scoring function that consists of a weighted sum of the three scores for selection of the self-generated pseudo-demonstrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We concatenate the pseudo-demonstrations into test questions, feed them to the LLM, and obtain a final predicted answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidn_WHASrzLG7rsqvKr5XqTi0VE0hEonQJsCRy0XHnM_DsWP4u1izMPUvfakpLd9FJvu47XXspD3vgIXrnrEhbrGR5vxSkcRRtbrU7HwHh6zLpywepMg39GUAW6uSVYxW-JzdOl5IVt9KPqLDVVCvjz86e6vQgZK79FKAF5wGdpztohbWhe7tVtVwcNBgh/s949/image4.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidn_WHASrzLG7rsqvKr5XqTi0VE0hEonQJsCRy0XHnM_DsWP4u1izMPUvfakpLd9FJvu47XXspD3vgIXrnrEhbrGR5vxSkcRRtbrU7HwHh6zLpywepMg39GUAW6uSVYxW-JzdOl5IVt9KPqLDVVCvjz86e6vQgZK79FKAF5wGdpztohbWhe7tVtVwcNBgh/s16000/image4.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;Illustration of COSP: In Stage 1 (&lt;strong&gt;left&lt;/strong&gt;), we run zero-shot CoT multiple times to generate a pool of demonstrations (each consisting of the question, generated rationale and prediction) and assign a score. In Stage 2 (&lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;), we augment the current test question with pseudo-demos (blue boxes) and query the LLM again. A majority vote over outputs from both stages forms the final prediction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
COSP focuses on question-answering tasks with CoT prompting for which it is easy to measure self-consistency since the questions have unique correct answers. But this can be difficult for other tasks, such as open-ended question-answering or generative tasks that don’t have unique answers (e.g., text summarization). To address this limitation, we introduce USP in which we generalize our approach to other general NLP tasks:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Classification&lt;/em&gt; (CLS): Problems where we can compute the probability of each class using the neural network output logits of each class. In this way, we can measure the uncertainty without multiple sampling by computing the entropy of the logit distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short-form generation&lt;/em&gt; (SFG): Problems like question answering where we can use the same procedure mentioned above for COSP, but, if necessary, without the rationale-generating step.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-form generation&lt;/em&gt; (LFG):&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Problems like summarization and translation, where the questions are often open-ended and the outputs are unlikely to be identical, even if the LLM is certain. In this case, we use an &lt;em&gt;overlap metric&lt;/em&gt; in which we compute the average of the &lt;em&gt;pairwise&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)"&gt;ROUGE score&lt;/a&gt; between the different outputs to the same query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn2mgVNUmsKVPYKo3zrcQnq3nHT0xIzCk2rIOK0fSrFIOEkyCrx7MWNnTrOdwnFRlGbid1cj8OqV2xBCfOtgv5oiuUPoQjRY9CpMnjM79P0mQmoyQqluMPZsqFQUtS7AtPy5Uw-sf5UT_dV_bRbGWSRQiR5U2tDIYd2zxsk_lboJsKG4mcBZKxp5gEeT_T/s1360/image3.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn2mgVNUmsKVPYKo3zrcQnq3nHT0xIzCk2rIOK0fSrFIOEkyCrx7MWNnTrOdwnFRlGbid1cj8OqV2xBCfOtgv5oiuUPoQjRY9CpMnjM79P0mQmoyQqluMPZsqFQUtS7AtPy5Uw-sf5UT_dV_bRbGWSRQiR5U2tDIYd2zxsk_lboJsKG4mcBZKxp5gEeT_T/s16000/image3.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;Illustration of USP in exemplary tasks (classification, QA and text summarization). Similar to COSP, the LLM first generates predictions on an unlabeled dataset whose outputs are scored with logit entropy, consistency or alignment, depending on the task type, and pseudo-demonstrations are selected from these input-output pairs. In Stage 2, the test instances are augmented with pseudo-demos for prediction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
We compute the relevant confidence scores depending on the type of task on the aforementioned set of unlabeled test samples. After scoring, similar to COSP, we pick the confident, diverse and less repetitive answers to form a model-generated pseudo-demonstration set. We finally query the LLM again in a few-shot format with these pseudo-demonstrations to obtain the final predictions on the entire test set.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;h2&gt;Key Results&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
For COSP, we focus on a set of six arithmetic and commonsense reasoning problems, and we compare against 0-shot-CoT (i.e., “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916"&gt;Let’s think step by step&lt;/a&gt;“ only). We use self-consistency in all baselines so that they use roughly the same amount of computational resources as COSP. Compared across three LLMs, we see that zero-shot COSP significantly outperforms the standard zero-shot baseline.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
For USP, we expand our analysis to a much wider range of tasks, including more than 25 classifications, short-form generation, and long-form generation tasks. Using the state-of-the-art PaLM 2 models, we also test against the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261"&gt;BIG-Bench Hard&lt;/a&gt; suite of tasks where LLMs have previously underperformed compared to people. We show that in all cases, USP again outperforms the baselines and is competitive to prompting with golden examples. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsJh9EIxiF8m6jqOM7vYniG6LX8gFVa0W3V7_DEOwMCEZjbk_M4104Tg-3qMUAbYXaR3RqMTQsrZ8TN3Np5I9SXHBVJGjB6E6_1khoubPbbR-AjUnV37TYGBHu2DJpR50Ek34dwcFkjJB-OTqW4T4E-zjQhJqPX-f_PxSj7322nU2qH2VK0TBMO1QKUkfT/s901/image5.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsJh9EIxiF8m6jqOM7vYniG6LX8gFVa0W3V7_DEOwMCEZjbk_M4104Tg-3qMUAbYXaR3RqMTQsrZ8TN3Np5I9SXHBVJGjB6E6_1khoubPbbR-AjUnV37TYGBHu2DJpR50Ek34dwcFkjJB-OTqW4T4E-zjQhJqPX-f_PxSj7322nU2qH2VK0TBMO1QKUkfT/w592-h640/image5.png" width="592" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;Accuracy on BIG-Bench Hard tasks with PaLM 2-M (each line represents a task of the suite). The gain/loss of USP (green stars) over standard 0-shot (green triangles) is shown in percentages. “Human” refers to average human performance; “AutoCoT” and “Random demo” are baselines we compared against in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14926"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;; and “3-shot” is the few-shot performance for three handcrafted demos in CoT format.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;
We also analyze the working mechanism of USP by validating the key observation above on the relation between confidence and correctness, and we found that in an overwhelming majority of the cases, USP picks confident predictions that are more likely better in all task types considered, as shown in the figure below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjahSci_hJqgqxS-my79ZlINe9Dpi0yaLrMTXeTu-HXjmmAmhVXtylXK7BUdJGIPMFhFvqv31Wd6ux2ti1hJLIi9Rr8j_PIjD9ElUTWx0ViaP1fLg63Q9lqvgd7U74Uqi45IOU3CsqHaqjO94iSLyPD2dZCJf5x5hsHfU_6yukbJHpG6wDzdSVp7nwBHNFx/s1474/image2.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjahSci_hJqgqxS-my79ZlINe9Dpi0yaLrMTXeTu-HXjmmAmhVXtylXK7BUdJGIPMFhFvqv31Wd6ux2ti1hJLIi9Rr8j_PIjD9ElUTWx0ViaP1fLg63Q9lqvgd7U74Uqi45IOU3CsqHaqjO94iSLyPD2dZCJf5x5hsHfU_6yukbJHpG6wDzdSVp7nwBHNFx/s16000/image2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em style="text-align: left;"&gt;USP picks confident predictions that are more likely better. Ground-truth performance metrics against USP confidence scores in selected tasks in various task types (blue: CLS, orange: SFG, green: LFG) with PaLM-540B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Zero-shot inference is a highly sought-after capability of modern LLMs, yet the success in which poses unique challenges. We propose COSP and USP, a family of versatile, zero-shot automatic prompting techniques applicable to a wide range of tasks. We show large improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines over numerous task and model combinations.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More ways for users to identify independently security tested apps on Google Play</title>
      <link>http://security.googleblog.com/2023/11/more-ways-for-users-to-identify.html</link>
      <description>&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Nataliya Stanetsky, Android Security and Privacy Team&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Keeping Google Play safe for users and developers remains a top priority for Google. As users increasingly prioritize their digital privacy and security, we continue to invest in our &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/data-safety/"&gt;Data Safety section&lt;/a&gt; and transparency labeling efforts to help users make more informed choices about the apps they use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://iotsecurityprivacy.org/research"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that transparent security labeling plays a crucial role in consumer risk perception, building trust, and influencing product purchasing decisions. We believe the same principles apply for labeling and badging in the Google Play store. The transparency of an app’s data security and privacy play a key role in a user’s decision to download, trust, and use an app.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Highlighting Independently Security Tested VPN Apps&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last year, App Defense Alliance (ADA) &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/app-defense-alliance-expansion.html"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; MASA (Mobile App Security Assessment), which allows developers to have their apps independently validated against a &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-app-security/"&gt;global&lt;/a&gt; security standard. This signals to users that an independent third-party has validated that the developers designed their apps to meet these industry mobile security and privacy minimum best practices and the developers are going the extra mile to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. This, in turn, makes it harder for attackers to reach users' devices and improves app quality across the ecosystem. Upon completion of the successful validation, Google Play gives developers the option to declare an “Independent security review” badge in its Data Safety section, as shown in the image below. While certification to baseline security standards does not imply that a product is free of vulnerabilities, the badge associated with these validated apps helps users see at-a-glance that a developer has prioritized security and privacy practices and committed to user safety.  
&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-bur36840wvlCyW9uYY9bV_at1TiM3Va9mBaxxXPEYXHz4Ckoc1p_mLq9OWJ0aLZbB24ePm8CiTcrfI76ozLTkF7slHAhtk3U7oT8sKxnjM-DOUubll2T_a9p9hyPBNZtRpH9cH3hfqVRdTxMtHzMsgAEsP2uK0AajKoANMdRjZ5WphFV3c3H8dNC5G8i/s1600/independent-review-wrapped.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-bur36840wvlCyW9uYY9bV_at1TiM3Va9mBaxxXPEYXHz4Ckoc1p_mLq9OWJ0aLZbB24ePm8CiTcrfI76ozLTkF7slHAhtk3U7oT8sKxnjM-DOUubll2T_a9p9hyPBNZtRpH9cH3hfqVRdTxMtHzMsgAEsP2uK0AajKoANMdRjZ5WphFV3c3H8dNC5G8i/s1600/independent-review-wrapped.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;
To help give users a simplified view of which apps have undergone an &lt;a href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/masa"&gt;independent security validation&lt;/a&gt;, we’re introducing a new Google Play store banner for specific app types, starting with VPN apps. We’ve launched this banner beginning with VPN apps due to the sensitive and significant amount of user data these apps handle. When a user searches for VPN apps, they will now see a banner at the top of Google Play that educates them about the “Independent security review” badge in the Data Safety Section. Users also have the ability to “Learn More”, which redirects them to the &lt;a href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/directory?category=vpn"&gt;App Validation Directory&lt;/a&gt;, a centralized place to view all VPN apps that have been independently security reviewed. Users can also discover additional technical assessment details in the App Validation Directory, helping them to make more informed decisions about what VPN apps to download, use, and trust with their data. 

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgz8TSWR5-nrJ70yg1TBGGf8oUKlZSGkZ0yOWs3U8EcIsThHh1qGXOXK-L9AaRaY9p6ikw01BByQScARRFNZ2jlFUnYbBvoX8b8wOSoqWlBQpckNMkQC3pRL4X-LiYb21V9gyW24Fyc6YEeKLqRd3m3xwbAS3qETWuTk5yUziuU8-yH1W5RF3eN_vuQFrc0/s976/play-store-vpn-wrapped.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="600" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgz8TSWR5-nrJ70yg1TBGGf8oUKlZSGkZ0yOWs3U8EcIsThHh1qGXOXK-L9AaRaY9p6ikw01BByQScARRFNZ2jlFUnYbBvoX8b8wOSoqWlBQpckNMkQC3pRL4X-LiYb21V9gyW24Fyc6YEeKLqRd3m3xwbAS3qETWuTk5yUziuU8-yH1W5RF3eN_vuQFrc0/s600/play-store-vpn-wrapped.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

VPN providers such as NordVPN, Google One, ExpressVPN, and others have already undergone independent security testing and publicly declared the badge showing their good standing with the MASA program. We encourage and anticipate additional VPN app developers to undergo independent security testing, bringing even more transparency to users. If you are a VPN developer and interested in learning more about this feature, please &lt;a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/mindependentsecurityreview/"&gt;submit this form&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Our Commitment to App Security and Privacy Transparency on Google Play&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By encouraging independent security testing and displaying security badges for validated apps, we highlight developers who prioritize user safety and data transparency.  We also provide developers with app security and privacy best practices – through &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=iuIe1B2CKCxFBhCY&amp;amp;v=FuYjzf8lymw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;Play PolicyBytes videos&lt;/a&gt;, webinars, &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/?sjid=12212977848216103339-NA"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/community?hl=en"&gt;Developer Help Community&lt;/a&gt;, and other resources – in accordance with our developer policies that help keep Google Play safe. We are continually working on improvements to our app review process, policies, and programs to keep users safe and to help developers navigate our policies with ease. To learn more about how we give developers the tools to succeed while keeping users safe on Google Play, read the &lt;a href="https://safety.google/intl/en_us/stories/google-play-safety/"&gt;Google Safety Center&lt;/a&gt; article.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our efforts to prioritize security and privacy transparency on Google Play are aligned with the needs and expectations we’ve heard from both users and developers. We believe that by prioritizing initiatives that bolster user safety and trust, we can foster a thriving app ecosystem where users can make more informed app decisions and developers are encouraged to uphold the highest standards of security and privacy.

      <title>CodeSOD: Not My Domain</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/not-my-domain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dian&lt;/strong&gt; found this code snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-java"&gt;String[] key_value = url.split(&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"\\."&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i=key_value.length; i&amp;gt;&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i--) {
        &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (i &amp;gt; &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
                domain = key_value[i-&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;]+&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"."&lt;/span&gt;+key_value[i-&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;];
        &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm still not sure what this is supposed to do," Dian writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is someone's attempt to extract the TLD and primary domain from a URL, e.g. &lt;code&gt;www.mysite.com&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;mysite.com&lt;/code&gt;. (Remember when &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;s were on every domain name?) Why they chose to use a loop that only executes once, I'll never understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: Also, so many ways this code could fail --&gt;&lt;div&gt;

      <title>Complete Guide on How to Conduct an Effective Customer and Segmentation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/how-to-write-customer-analysis/</link>
      <description>&lt;img alt="Complete Guide on How to Conduct an Effective Customer and Segmentation Analysis" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/istock-503712960-1-.jpg" style="float: right;" title="Complete Guide on How to Conduct an Effective Customer and Segmentation Analysis" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of undertaking customer analysis as part of a business plan is to examine the consumers most likely to purchase your product or service in-depth. Brands can establish different groups of customers and the needs of those customers. By understanding what motivates them to make a purchase, brands can build their business around providing solutions to those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer analysis should move through three different stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You first need to identify who your current customers are. The more detailed understanding you have of your customers the better. This one group of customers should then be split into sub-groups that have similar traits and motivations. You can also identify target customers you are not yet reaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer analysis must then show what the needs of these different customer groups are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You then need to work out what bridges these two, identifying how the company&amp;#8217;s products meet the needs of each customer group. How do you provide solutions to their pain points?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;[bw_also_like id=&amp;#8221;84283&amp;#8243;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who are your customers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about your customers in a variety of ways, and a mix of research methods will give you the most accurate results. It is best to gather as much information as possible, and to not fall into thinking details are irrelevant. Details like age, gender, location, demographics and psychographics are all important, but so are their interests, other brands they like, publications they read and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to them and running a survey will be the best way of hearing about them in their own words, although that does come with biases. Reduce this by complementing that research with sales data, CRM data, and speaking to customer-facing employees. Once you have identified these groups, social data can elaborate your understanding by providing a more holistic view of the groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="customer analysis involves identifying who your customer actually are" class="aligncenter wp-image-87268" height="568" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock-183384139-1024x727.jpg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also worth considering at this stage if the buyer and user are the same person. In a B2B setting, the buyer might hold budget responsibility but not actually use the service/software/product. In a B2C setting, there are several situations when a buyer might not be the user; a toy water pistol or a diamond ring are unlikely to be used by the purchaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Segment these groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot undertake an accurate customer analysis without segmenting your audience into groups whose members are homogenous while being distinct from other groups. Your segmentation criteria should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; Your analysis should identify the size of a market segment so that you can decide to what extent efforts should be focused on the segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinguishable:&lt;/strong&gt; Observable differences that are clearly defined must exist in order to characterize segments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substantial:&lt;/strong&gt; The market needs to be large enough to justify segmenting, with each segment substantial enough to make it worthwhile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial:&lt;/strong&gt; There will be additional costs when marketing to multiple, separate groups, so the predicted income must exceed these costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible:&lt;/strong&gt; Your marketing messages should be accessible to each market segment. Different groups will respond better to different forms of advertising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="segment your customers like they're sweets" class="aligncenter wp-image-87270" height="600" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock-172641079-1024x768.jpg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Develop customer profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your data, your segmentation criteria, some educated guesswork, and &lt;a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/buyer-personas-wrong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;develop some buyer personas&lt;/a&gt;. It helps to have personas so you can visualize a human rather than aiming for an abstract idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements to include in a buyer persona include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background and responsibilities:&lt;/b&gt; including job title, career path, and their primary job responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demographics:&lt;/b&gt; gender, age, income, family, and location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communication:&lt;/b&gt; which channels do they prefer? What is their demeanor? Do they have an assistant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Media and influencers:&lt;/b&gt; which publications do they follow, and which individuals are leading the conversation in their world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenges vs proposition:&lt;/b&gt; The challenges they face in implementing their primary job goals and how your product or service can help them overcome those issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objections:&lt;/b&gt; common reasons why this persona wouldn’t choose your product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Common language:&lt;/b&gt; what language should you use to appeal to their needs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quotes:&lt;/b&gt; adding some qualitative data in the form of quotes can really help to bring the personas to life and remind you there are real people behind these aggregated models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discover their needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in customer analysis is to get a good idea of what the customer&amp;#8217;s needs are. By understanding their needs, several departments can gear their output towards answering these questions, rather than taking an &amp;#8220;If you build it, they will come&amp;#8221; approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="maze" class="aligncenter wp-image-87271" height="533" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock-123496282-1024x683.jpg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways to do discover what your customers&amp;#8217; pain points are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way is to ask them. A survey is great if you can get enough responses and online services like &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SurveyMonkey&lt;/a&gt; can keep the cost down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the past actions of the group, such as the percentage that have purchased a similar product at some time in the past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at questions asked on &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For B2B businesses, looking at job adverts for your target customers can give you an insight into their day to day work and problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join LinkedIn professional groups to get an insight into questions and discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social intelligence can again help to understand the issues faced by customers. You can begin by building an audience of your personas, and then monitor that group for questions asked, relevant content shared (such as How To guides), and discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does your brand meet the needs of the customer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve done your research and outlined your different customer groups and their needs, you should connect the dots to your brand and identify how you meet those needs. This section of customer analysis should just be a matter of discussing and brainstorming with internal partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="key in door" class="aligncenter wp-image-87272" height="533" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock-519362709-1024x683.jpg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution based answers should come out of this process. Rather than saying, &amp;#8220;we have these features&amp;#8221;, you should be focusing on how those features deliver solutions to the problems faced by your customers and prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving the problems that customers face on a daily basis will resonate with them much better than shouting about a shiny new feature. Focus on how you can make their lives easier and more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will obviously be reflected in marketing, but these insights can help sales and &lt;a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/new-product-development-research/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;product development&lt;/a&gt; as well, tightening your focus to better match your customer&amp;#8217;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;[bw_banner_cta type=2]Get closer to your customers. Discover how to use social listening to support your customer analysis.[/bw_banner_cta]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

      <title>Announcing the Linux package archive site</title>
      <link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-linux-package-archive-site</link>
      <description>**关键词**：HashiCorp, Linux操作系统, EoL, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL

**大纲**：文章介绍了HashiCorp公司将停止支持已经到达终止生命周期（EoL）状态的Linux操作系统版本，并将这些软件包移至新的归档站点。文章列出了受影响的版本，并提供了更新现有系统以减少影响的方法。此外，文章还提到了RHEL的特殊情况，并说明了如何操作。最后，文章介绍了归档站点以及对EoL版本的常见问题解答。

**总结**：HashiCorp公司宣布将停止支持已经到达终止生命周期的Linux操作系统版本，并将这些版本的软件包移至归档站点。用户需要及时更新系统以继续获得软件包管理器的支持。对于RHEL的特殊情况，用户需要将系统更新为主要版本，并参考官方的包装指南进行配置。归档站点将提供EoL和RHEL的旧版本软件包下载，但HashiCorp将不再维护这些软件包。用户可以通过自行创建本地仓库来使用这些软件包。文章还附上了常见问题解答以解决读者的疑问。用户如有问题或关注事项，可以在HashiCorp Discuss上发帖进行讨论。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 10th, 2024, HashiCorp will no longer support versions of Linux operating systems that have reached end-of-life (EoL) status. We will move these packages to the new &lt;a href="https://archive.releases.hashicorp.com/"&gt;archive site&lt;/a&gt; where users can continue to download them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that package managers will no longer be able to download packages for these versions. To help you update existing systems to minimize impact when we stop publishing versions that have reached EoL, please see the list of impacted versions below: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora:&lt;/strong&gt; 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, and 37&lt;em&gt;, _(&lt;/em&gt;Fedora 37 will reach EoL status November 2023)_&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu:&lt;/strong&gt; Eoan, Hirsute, Impish, Groovy, and Kinetic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian:&lt;/strong&gt; Jessie and Stretch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Special case: RHEL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems will need to be updated to use the major versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) (7, 8, and 9) see our &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/official-packaging-guide"&gt;Official Packaging Guide&lt;/a&gt; for the appropriate &lt;code&gt;hashicorp.repo&lt;/code&gt; configuration. While they are not EoL versions, as part of this effort we are also removing the minor version aliases of RHEL, which include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7Server, 7Workstation, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Archival site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have migrated our EoL and RHEL minor distributions to the &lt;a href="https://archive.releases.hashicorp.com"&gt;archive site&lt;/a&gt; and users can download the packages from there instead of releases.hashicorp.com. HashiCorp will no longer be responsible for maintaining the EoL/RHEL minor packages on the archive site. Use these packages at your own risk. We highly recommend users migrate to an OS version that is currently supported by package maintainers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make these changes as clear as possible, we have created a short FAQ list below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What changes must practitioners make to continue using Linux packages from HashiCorp?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone using EoL distributions will need to upgrade their OS (and existing systems) to continue having package manager support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone currently changing their repo configs to reference RHEL minor versions will need to revert to major versions. This applies only to HashiCorp repositories, users can continue targeting minor versions for other repos if that suits them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If users want to use any EoL or RHEL minor distributions, they will need to pull from the archive site instead of the production sites (&lt;code&gt;[apt|rpm].releases.hashicorp.com&lt;/code&gt;). However, we highly encourage users to migrate and use current versions. HashiCorp will not offer official support or publish any updates to fix issues with EoL packages on the archive site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: If a user is running on supported versions of HashiCorp products but on an EoL OS, what is the workaround?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Users can install via .zip instead of Linux packages or download the packages manually from &lt;a href="https://archive.releases.hashicorp.com/"&gt;https://archive.releases.hashicorp.com/&lt;/a&gt; and create their own local repo (users can generate their own metadata, allowing their hosts to then use the local repo via package managers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Will moving EoL versions to the archive site become a regular thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. This process will become a regular occurance when a distribution version reaches end-of-life status. We will follow the EoL cycles that distribution maintainers have set up for their distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have concerns or questions, please create a post on &lt;a href="https://discuss.hashicorp.com/"&gt;HashiCorp Discuss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Experts predict &lt;a href="https://insights.co-opfs.org/blog/3-fraud-predictions-for-2023#:~:text=According%20to%20estimates%20from%20the,series%20of%20seemingly%20innocuous%20steps."&gt;billions in fraud losses&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2023, with over $635B related to account takeover (ATO). ATOs are a type of cyberattack that result in the unauthorized access of an account, typically through the use of stolen credentials. Once an account has been compromised, it may be used to launch additional attacks, make fraudulent purchases or transactions, or steal other personal information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the Sift network, we’re seeing rising signs of automation-fueled ATO and downstream payment fraud. To understand these evolving fraud trends and get a first-hand look at the severity of these threats, Sift Trust and Safety Architects analyzed new network data and consumer insights* in our latest &lt;a href="https://resources.sift.com/ebook/q3-2023-digital-trust-safety-index-account-takeover-data-consumer-insights-and-emerging-trends/"&gt;Digital Trust &amp;amp; Safety Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Explore the following infographic and &lt;a href="https://resources.sift.com/ebook/q3-2023-digital-trust-safety-index-account-takeover-data-consumer-insights-and-emerging-trends/"&gt;read the full report&lt;/a&gt; to learn which industries were hit hardest by ATO this year, new ways fraudsters are leveraging automation to launch widespread attacks at scale, and how ATO leads to brand abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*The data highlighted in this report is derived from Sift’s global data network of one trillion (1T) events, and compares findings from Q2 2022 to Q2 2023. This report also includes insights gathered on behalf of Sift by Researchscape, which polled 1,035 U.S. adults (aged 18+) in July of 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**总结：**
这篇文章提出了一种使用用户反馈和生成模型来提高通知邮件的用户参与度的方法。当前，通用的生成AI模型在生成内容时忽略了用户参与反馈和需求。为了解决这个问题，Nextdoor使用拒绝抽样和奖励模型来生成更有吸引力的主题行。他们的方法包括了技术细节，例如原始文本提取、奖励模型开发和成本优化。他们的实验结果显示，他们的方法可以比用户生成的主题行更有效地提高用户参与度 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generative AI (Gen AI) has demonstrated proficiency in content generation but does not consistently guarantee user engagement, mainly for two reasons. First, Gen AI generates content without considering user engagement feedback. While the content may be informative and well-written, it does not always translate to increased user engagement such as clicks. Second, Gen AI-produced content often remains generic and may not always provide the specific information that users seek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nextdoor is the neighborhood network where neighbors, businesses, and public agencies connect with each other. Nextdoor is building innovative solutions to enhance the user engagement with AI-Generated Content (AIGC). This post outlines our approach to improving user engagement through user feedback, specifically focusing on Notification email subject lines. Our solutions employ Rejection sampling [1], a technique used in reinforcement learning, to boost the engagement metrics. We believe our work presents a general framework to drive user engagement with AIGC, particularly when off-the-shelf Generative AI falls short in producing engaging content. To the best of our knowledge, this marks an early milestone in the industry’s successful use of AIGC to enhance user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Nextdoor, one of the ways to drive user growth and engagement on platform is through emails. One of the emails we have is called New and Trending &lt;a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/nextdoor-notifications-how-we-use-ml-to-keep-neighbors-informed-57d8f707aab0"&gt;notifications&lt;/a&gt;, where we send a single post that we think the user might be interested in and want to engage with. As part of sending an email, we need to determine a subject line of the email for the email audiences. Historically, we simply pick the first few words of the post being sent to be the subject line. However, in certain posts, these initial words are often greetings or introductory remarks and may not provide valuable information to the user. In the provided image example below, we observe a simple greeting, “Hello!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/707/0*1bUjaLCj0AOjUIe0" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1. New and Trending email where we show a single post. Prior to the Gen AI systems we build, we use the first words of the post as the subject line (Life and Mother Nature always find a way!)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we aim to use Generative AI technologies to improve the subject line. With Generative AI, we aim to generate informative and interesting subject lines that will lead to more email opens, clicks and eventually more sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a good subject line with Generative AI is challenging because the subject line needs to satisfy the following criteria. First and foremost, the subject line needs to be engaging so that the users want to open the email. To see if ChatGPT API can write engaging subject lines, we tried generating subject lines with ChatGPT API with a small traffic A/B test, and found that the users are less likely to click on emails if we use subject lines made by ChatGPT API (e.g. Table 1). As we show later, we tried to improve the prompts (prompt engineering) but the results were still inferior to the user-generated subjects. This finding implies that Generative AI models are not trained to write the content that is particularly engaging to our users, and we need to guide Generative AI models to increase user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/991/1*L4Uumzj8svXajgd07AUOtQ.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Table 1. Subject line made by ChatGPT API and its CTR. ChatGPT API’s subject line is more informative but looks like a marketing phrase, and produced only 56% clicks compared to the user-generated subject line.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second challenge is that the subject line needs to be authentic. If it reads like a marketing phrase, the email will look like spam. The example in Table 1 “Support backyard chickens in Papillion, NE!” shows this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, the subject line should not contain hallucinations (a response that is nonsensical or not accurate). And it is well known that Generative AI is vulnerable to hallucinations [2]. For example, given a very short post saying “Sun bathing ☀️”, ChatGPT API in Table 1 generated the subject line “Soak Up the Sun: Tips for Relaxing Sun Bathing Sessions”, which had nothing to do with the post content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a novel Generative AI method to overcome the three challenges faced by the ChatGPT API mentioned above. We made three contributions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt engineering to generate authentic subject lines with no hallucination:&lt;/strong&gt; Given a post, ChatGPT API creates a subject line by extracting the most interesting phrases of the post without any rewriting. By extracting the user’s original writing, we are able to prevent marketing phrases and hallucinations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejection sampling with a reward model: &lt;/strong&gt;To find the most interesting subject line, we develop a reward model whose job is to predict if the users would prefer a given subject line over other subject lines. After ChatGPT API writes a subject line, we evaluate it by the reward model and accept it only if its reward model score is higher than the user-written subject line’s score. This technique is called Rejection Sampling and recently introduced to Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model training [1].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost optimization and model accuracy maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;: We added engineering components to minimize the serving cost and stabilize the model performance. By using caching, we reduced our cost to 1/600 compared to the brute-force way. By daily performance monitoring, we can catch if reward models fail to predict which subject is more engaging due to external factors such as user preference drift and address it by retraining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that this framework is generally applicable when off-the-shelf Generative AI fails to improve user engagement. We also analyzed the importance of each component in our design. Even with the aforementioned prompt engineering, ChatGPT API did not necessarily produce more engaging content. This highlights the necessity of the rejection sampling component: in such cases, we can develop another AI model as a reward model and use the Generative AI’s output only if the reward model approves [1].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Proposed Method&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every post, we employ the following system to create a subject line. It’s important to mention that we generate a single subject line for each post, without personalization. This decision was made to minimize computational cost. Exploring cost-effective methods for implementing personalized subject lines will be an interesting future work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Model Overview&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 illustrates our approach. We develop two different AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subject line generator: This model generates a subject line given a post content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reward model (Evaluator): Given a subject line and the post content, this model predicts if the given subject line would be the better subject line than the user-generated subject line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/893/1*ejkWUk9i9BBrI74iU7g1XA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2. Overview of our approach.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a post, the Subject line generator produces subjects in Figure 2 (green boxes). The reward model compares the OpenAI API subject line (green) with the user-generated subject line (red), and selects the more engaging one. For the top post, the OpenAI API subject line contains more relevant information and is selected. For the bottom post which was about a health alert, the reward model selects the user-generated subject. While the OpenAI API subject line shows the main content of the alert, the reward model picks the user-generated subject because it shows the importance of the post and thus is more engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Developing Subject Line Generator&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use OpenAI API without fine-tuning. In the prompt, we require that OpenAI API extracts the most interesting part of the post without making any change. This way of extracting user content provides multiple benefits: First, it removes hallucinations. Second, it keeps the subject line authentic as OpenAI API does not rewrite the original content. To test the prompt engineering, we A/B tested generator outputs without reward models. We found that asking OpenAI API to extract in the prompt improves Sessions by 3% relatively compared to asking OpenAI API to rewrite the subject line from scratch (See the Results section for the details).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Developing Reward Model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fine-tune OpenAI API to develop a reward model. This is the main innovation we applied on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training data collection: &lt;/strong&gt;The challenge is to collect training data on which subject line was more engaging. Manual annotation is not possible because there are no rules deciding what subject line is more engaging. We found that the subject lines that we thought to be more engaging than the user-generated ones turned out to be less engaging (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/956/1*WgqJAkjrCROtF0SfXCz4qA.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Table 2. Emails with a user-generated subject (left) generated 3x as many clicks as the emails with OpenAI API-generated subjects on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this issue, we collect training data via experimentation. For each post, we generate subject lines in two ways. One way is to use user-generated ones and the other is to use the OpenAI API generator described above. Then we serve 2–3% users (~20k) that are randomly selected with each subject line. The goal is to learn which subject line was more engaging through click data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model training:&lt;/strong&gt; We used OpenAI API to fine-tune with the labels we collected. We used ~50k examples and 40% of examples had the OpenAI API subject as the winning subject and the rest had the user subject as the winner. Given a subject line and post content, our model is fine-tuned to predict if the subject line would generate more engagement (clicks) than the user-generated subject line. The model is asked to predict if the subject line is more engaging and output “Yes” or “No”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training details:&lt;/strong&gt; We used the smallest OpenAI API model “ada” for fine-tuning. We found that larger models did not improve the predictive performance despite higher cost. We added &lt;a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5247780-using-logit-bias-to-define-token-probability"&gt;a logit bias&lt;/a&gt; of 100 for “Yes” and “No”. These biases boost the probability for the model to output “Yes” or “No”. We tried to change the number of epochs and selected the model with 4 epochs, but we did not see much difference in offline performance after 2–3 epochs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering details:&lt;/strong&gt; We added the following components for optimization and safeguarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caching: &lt;/strong&gt;For each post, we cache the outputs of our model. By processing each post only once, we reduced the cost to 1/600. In other words, each post gets sent 600 times on average and we process the post only once instead of 600 times. Caching also optimizes the OpenAI API usages (the number of tokens and the number of requests).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward model performance maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;: We monitor the reward model’s predictive performance daily, using the next day’s user clicks after the training phase as the ground truth to compare with the model’s output. Model’s predictive performance can change because our users’ preference may change and the content in Nextdoor can shift in the writing styles or topics.&lt;br /&gt;For monitoring purposes, we collect the engagement performance of different subject lines in the following way. We created a “control” user bucket where we always send emails with the user-generated subject and a “always OpenAI API” bucket where we always send with the OpenAI API subject, regardless of the reward model’s output. From these two buckets, we know the ground-truth on which subject line was more engaging, and measure the reward model’s accuracy. If the accuracy goes down by 10+%, we retrain the reward model with new data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retries with Fallback: &lt;/strong&gt;Since OpenAI API may return an error due to the rate limit or transient issues, we added retries with&lt;a href="https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt; exponential backoffs with Tenacity&lt;/a&gt;. If we fail after a certain number of retries, we fallback to the user-generated subject.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling the length of output: &lt;/strong&gt;We found that the Subject line generator would write a subject line longer than our desired length (10 words). This happened even if we specified the 10 word limit in the instruction and added examples. We post-processed the generator output by cutting the first 10 words from the generator’s output. We A/B tested different word limits and found that 10 is the optimal value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did A/B tests with different versions of the subject line generator, and with and without the reward model. For the generator, we tested the following options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing with OpenAI API: We ask OpenAI API to “write an engaging subject line for a given post”. This was the first version we tested without much prompt engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extracting with OpenAI API: We ask OpenAI API to extract the most interesting part and provide 5 examples. We also add requirements in a numbered list such as “Do not insert or remove any word.”, “Do not change capitalization”, “If the first 10 words are interesting, use them as a subject line”. We tried 4 different versions of prompts and picked the best version by A/B test metrics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the A/B test metrics, we primarily focus on Sessions. A session is an activity sequence made by the same user within a certain timeframe, and sessions quantify the number of unique user visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table 3 shows the results on Session lift compared to the “control” bucket where we use user-generated subject lines. In addition to the session metrics, our final model (last row) increased Weekly Active Users by 0.4% and Ads revenue by 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/955/1*60AFxqFwmZ39d8g2h5NQUw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Table 3. Session lift compared to the user-generated subject lines from A/B tests. The final model (last row) achieved 1% lift in sessions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is what we learned from A/B tests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prompt engineering improves the performance but has a ceiling. After a few iterations, the A/B test metrics showed only marginal improvements, failing to beat the control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding the “optimal” prompt is an elusive task, as the space of potential prompts is boundless, making it difficult to explore. Moreover, there is no established algorithmic or systematic method for enhancing prompts. Instead, the task relies on human judgment and intuition to update the prompt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reward model was the key factor in improving sessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predicting popular content is challenging, as is the reward model’s task of forecasting popular subject lines, which currently achieves about 65% accuracy. Enhancing the reward model’s performance by leveraging real-time signals like the current engagement numbers for the subject can be an interesting future work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a novel Generative AI system to increase user engagement by combining the reward model and prompt engineering. Our systems have engineering components for cost saving and monitoring. A/B tests showed that our systems can deliver more engaging subject lines than the user-generated subject lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many avenues for future work. First is to fine-tune the subject line generator. In this work, we used vanilla ChatGPT API as the generator. Instead, we can fine tune OpenAI API with the most engaging titles that the reward model identifies. For each post, we generate multiple subject lines and use the reward model to pick the winner. Then we use the winner subject to fine tune the subject line generator. This approach is called Reinforcement Learning by Rejection Sampling [1].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second is to rescore the same post daily. Currently, we pick the best subject line with a reward model once and never rescore. However, as time goes on, we may be able to see which of the OpenAI API subject line or user-generated subject line is getting more engagement, and our reward model can predict more accurately. Third is to add personalization without significantly escalating computational costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post was written by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaewonyang/"&gt;Jaewon Yang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/qi-he/"&gt;Qi He&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was led by the Generative AI team with cross-org collaboration between Notification team and ML teams.

      <title>Performance Improvements in ASP.NET Core 8</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-aspnet-core-8/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET Core 8 and .NET 8 bring many exciting performance improvements. In this blog post, we will highlight some of the enhancements made in ASP.NET Core and show you how they can boost your web app&amp;#8217;s speed and efficiency. This is a continuation of last year&amp;#8217;s post on &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-aspnet-core-7/"&gt;Performance improvements in ASP.NET Core 7&lt;/a&gt;. And, of course, it continues to be inspired by &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8"&gt;Performance Improvements in .NET 8&lt;/a&gt;. Many of those improvements either indirectly or directly improve the performance of ASP.NET Core as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="benchmarking-setup"&gt;Benchmarking Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/benchmarkdotnet"&gt;BenchmarkDotNet&lt;/a&gt; for many of the examples in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To setup a benchmarking project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new console app (&lt;code&gt;dotnet new console&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Nuget reference to BenchmarkDotnet (&lt;code&gt;dotnet add package BenchmarkDotnet&lt;/code&gt;) version 0.13.8+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change Program.cs to &lt;code&gt;var summary = BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly).Run();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the benchmarking code snippet below that you want to run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;dotnet run -c Release&lt;/code&gt; and enter the number of the benchmark you want to run when prompted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the benchmarks test internal types, and a self-contained benchmark cannot be written. In those cases we&amp;#8217;ll either reference numbers that are gotten by running the benchmarks in the repository (and link to the code in the repository), or we&amp;#8217;ll provide a simplified example to showcase what the improvement is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some cases where we will reference our end-to-end benchmarks which are public at &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/aspnet/benchmarks"&gt;https://aka.ms/aspnet/benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;. Although we only display the last few months of data so that the page will load in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="servers"&gt;Servers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 3 server implementations in ASP.NET Core; Kestrel, Http.Sys, and IIS. The latter two are only usable on Windows and share a lot of code. Server performance is extremely important because it&amp;#8217;s what processes incoming requests and forwards them to your application code. The faster we can process a request, the faster you can start running application code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kestrel"&gt;Kestrel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Header parsing is one of the first parts of processing done by a server for every request. Which means the performance is critical to allow requests to reach your application code as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kestrel we read bytes off the connection into a &lt;code&gt;System.IO.Pipelines.Pipe&lt;/code&gt; which is essentially a list of &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;s. When parsing headers we are reading from that list of &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;s and have two different code paths. One for when the full header is inside a single &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; and another for when a header is split across multiple &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/45044"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#45044&lt;/a&gt; updated the second (slower) code path to avoid allocating a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; when parsing the header, as well as optimizes our &lt;code&gt;SequenceReader&lt;/code&gt; usage to mostly use the underlying &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySequence&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which can be faster in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resulted in a ~18% performance improvement for multi-span headers as well as making it allocation free which helps reduce GC pressure. The following microbenchmark is using internal types in Kestrel and isn&amp;#8217;t easy to isolate as a minimal sample. For those interested it is located &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/8ad057426fa6a27cd648b05684afddab9d97d3d9/src/Servers/Kestrel/perf/Microbenchmarks/HttpParserBenchmark.cs#L73"&gt;with the Kestrel source code&lt;/a&gt; and was run before and after the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="width: 36.6438%;"&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="width: 34.7651%;"&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 9.79866%;"&gt;Allocated&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 6.57718%;"&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 9.79866%;"&gt;48 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="width: 34.7651%;"&gt;MultispanUnicodeHeader &amp;#8211; After&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 9.12752%;"&gt;484.9 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 12.4832%;"&gt;2,062,450.8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 6.57718%;"&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 9.79866%;"&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an allocation profile of an end-to-end benchmark we run on our CI showing the different with this change. We reduced the &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; allocations of the scenario by 73%. From 7.8GB to 2GB (during the lifetime of the benchmark run).
&lt;img alt="shows byte[] allocations before and after change" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/10/multi-header-alloc.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/48368"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#48368&lt;/a&gt; replaced some internal custom vectorized code for ascii comparison checks with the new &lt;code&gt;Ascii&lt;/code&gt; class in .NET 8. This allowed us to remove ~400 lines of code and take advantage of improvements like AVX512 and ARM AdvSIMD that are implemented in the &lt;code&gt;Ascii&lt;/code&gt; code that we didn&amp;#8217;t have in Kestrel&amp;#8217;s implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="http-sys"&gt;Http.Sys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of 7.0 we removed some &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/43449"&gt;extra thread pool dispatching in Kestrel&lt;/a&gt; that improved performance significantly. More details are in &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-aspnet-core-7/#general-server"&gt;last years performance post&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of 8.0 we made similar changes to the Http.Sys server in &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44409"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44409&lt;/a&gt;. This improved our &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/blob/e3095f4021fef7171bb3ae86616b9156df39b7bd/src/Benchmarks/Middleware/JsonMiddleware.cs"&gt;Json end to end benchmark&lt;/a&gt; by 11% from ~469k to ~522k RPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another change we made affects large responses especially in higher latency connections. &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/47776"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#47776&lt;/a&gt; adds an on-by-default option to enable Kernel-mode response buffering. This allows application writes to be buffered in the OS layer regardless of whether the client connection has acked previous writes or not, and then the OS can optimize sending the data by parallelizing writes and/or sending larger chunks of data at a time. The benefits are clear when using connections with higher latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show a specific example we hosted a server in Sweden and a client in West Coast USA to create some latency in the connection. The following server code was used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csproj"&gt;var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.UseHttpSys(options =&amp;gt;
{
    options.UrlPrefixes.Add("http://+:12345");
    options.Authentication.Schemes = AuthenticationSchemes.None;
    options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = true;
    options.EnableKernelResponseBuffering = true; // &amp;lt;-- new setting in 8.0
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/file", () =&amp;gt;
{
    return TypedResults.File(File.Open("pathToLargeFile", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read));
});

app.Run();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latency was around 200ms (round-trip) between client and server and the server was responding to client requests with a 212MB file.
When setting &lt;code&gt;HttpSysOptions.EnableKernelResponseBuffering&lt;/code&gt; to false the file download took ~11 minutes. And when setting it to true it took ~30 seconds to download the file. That&amp;#8217;s a massive improvement, ~22x faster in this specific scenario!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on how response buffering works can be found in &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/wndp/buffering-in-http-sys"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44561"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44561&lt;/a&gt; refactors the internals of response writing in Http.Sys to remove a bunch of &lt;code&gt;GCHandle&lt;/code&gt; allocations and conveniently removes a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;GCHandle&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that was used to track handles for freeing. It does this by allocating and writing directly to &lt;code&gt;NativeMemory&lt;/code&gt; when writing headers. By not pinning managed memory we are reducing GC pressure and helping reduce heap fragmentation. A downside is that we need to be extra careful to free the memory because the allocations are no longer tracked by the GC.
Running a simple web app and tracking GCHandle usage shows that in 7.0 a small response with 4 headers was using 8 &lt;code&gt;GCHandle&lt;/code&gt;s per request, and when adding more headers it was using 2 more &lt;code&gt;GCHandle&lt;/code&gt;s per header. In 8.0 the same app was using only 4 &lt;code&gt;GCHandle&lt;/code&gt;s per request, regardless of the number of headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/45156"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#45156&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://github.com/ladeak"&gt;@ladeak&lt;/a&gt; improved the implementation of &lt;code&gt;HttpContext.Request.Headers.Keys&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HttpContext.Request.Headers.Count&lt;/code&gt; in Http.Sys, which is also the same implementation used by IIS so double win. Before, those properties had generic implementations that used &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/code&gt; and linq expressions. Now they manually count and minimize allocations, making accessing &lt;code&gt;Count&lt;/code&gt; completely allocation free.
This benchmark uses internal types, so I&amp;#8217;ll link to &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/8279d3f8ee47d5e249ef12a99e4d1cacfd5209ec/src/Servers/HttpSys/perf/Microbenchmarks/RequestHeaderBenchmarks.cs#L12"&gt;the microbenchmark source&lt;/a&gt; instead of providing a standalone microbenchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="native-aot"&gt;Native AOT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/"&gt;Native AOT&lt;/a&gt; was first introduced in .NET 7 and only worked with console applications and a limited number of libraries.
In .NET 8.0 we&amp;#8217;ve improved the number of libraries that are supported in Native AOT as well as &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/native-aot?view=aspnetcore-8.0#aspnet-core-and-native-aot-compatibility"&gt;added support for ASP.NET Core&lt;/a&gt; applications. AOT apps can have minimized disk footprint, reduced startup times, and reduced memory demand. But before we talk about AOT more and show some numbers, we should talk about a prerequisite, trimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in .NET 6 &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained"&gt;trimming applications&lt;/a&gt; became a fully supported feature. Enabling this feature with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PublishTrimmed&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/PublishTrimmed&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt; enables the trimmer to run during publish and remove code your application isn&amp;#8217;t using. This can result in smaller deployed application sizes, useful in scenarios where you are running on memory constrained devices. Trimming isn&amp;#8217;t free though, libraries might need to annotate types and method calls to tell the trimmer about code being used that the trimmer can&amp;#8217;t determine, otherwise the trimmer might trim away code you&amp;#8217;re relying on and your app won&amp;#8217;t run as expected. The trimmer will &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/fixing-warnings"&gt;raise warnings&lt;/a&gt; when it sees code that might not be compatible with trimming. Until .NET 8 the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;TrimMode&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; property for publishing web apps was set to &lt;code&gt;partial&lt;/code&gt;. This meant that only assemblies that explicitly stated they supported trimming would be trimmed. Now in 8.0, &lt;code&gt;full&lt;/code&gt; is used for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;TrimMode&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which means all assemblies used by the app will be trimmed. These settings are documented in the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-options#trimming-granularity"&gt;trimming options docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In .NET 6 and .NET 7 a lot of libraries weren&amp;#8217;t compatible with trimming yet, notably ASP.NET Core libraries. If you tried to publish a simple ASP.NET Core app in 7.0 you would get a bunch of trimmer warnings because most of ASP.NET Core didn&amp;#8217;t support trimming yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is an ASP.NET Core app to show trimming in net7.0 vs. net8.0. All the numbers are for a windows publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-xml"&gt;&amp;lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to no more warnings when publishing trimmed in net8.0, the app size is smaller because we&amp;#8217;ve annotated more libraries so the linker can find more code that isn&amp;#8217;t being used by the app. Part of annotating the libraries involved analyzing what code is being kept by the trimmer and changing code to improve what can be trimmed. You can see numerous PRs to help this effort; &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/47567"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#47567&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/47454"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#47454&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46082"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46082&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46015"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/45906"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#45906&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46020"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46020&lt;/a&gt;, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Publish duration&lt;/code&gt; field was calculated using the &lt;code&gt;Measure-Command&lt;/code&gt; in powershell (and deleting /bin/ and /obj/ between every run). As you can see, enabling trimming can increase the publish time because the trimmer has to analyze the whole program to see what it can remove, which isn&amp;#8217;t a free operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also introduced two smaller versions of &lt;code&gt;WebApplication&lt;/code&gt; if you want even smaller apps via &lt;code&gt;CreateSlimBuilder&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CreateEmptyBuilder&lt;/code&gt;.
Changing the previous app to use &lt;code&gt;CreateSlimBuilder&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;// dotnet publish --self-contained --runtime win-x64 --framework net8.0 -p:PublishTrimmed=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true --configuration Release
var builder = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Create();

app.Run((c) =&amp;gt; c.Response.WriteAsync("hello world"));

app.Run();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will result in an app size of 15.5MB.
And then going one step further with &lt;code&gt;CreateEmptyBuilder&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;// dotnet publish --self-contained --runtime win-x64 --framework net8.0 -p:PublishTrimmed=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true --configuration Release
var builder = WebApplication.CreateEmptyBuilder(new WebApplicationOptions()
{
    Args = args
});
var app = builder.Create();

app.Run((c) =&amp;gt; c.Response.WriteAsync("hello world"));

app.Run();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will result in an app size of 13.7MB, although in this case the app won&amp;#8217;t work because there is no server implementation registered. So if we add Kestrel via &lt;code&gt;builder.WebHost.UseKestrelCore();&lt;/code&gt; the app size becomes 15MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TFM&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Builder&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;App Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Create&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;17.3MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Slim&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;15.5MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Empty&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;13.7MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Empty+Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;15.0MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that both these APIs are available starting in 8.0 and remove a lot of defaults so it&amp;#8217;s more pay for play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#8217;ve taken a small look at trimming and seen that 8.0 has more trim compatible libraries, let&amp;#8217;s take a look at Native AOT. Just like with trimming, if your app/library isn&amp;#8217;t compatible with Native AOT you&amp;#8217;ll get warnings when building for Native AOT and there are &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net8plus%2Cwindows#limitations-of-native-aot-deployment"&gt;additional limitations&lt;/a&gt; to what works in Native AOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the same app as before, we&amp;#8217;ll enable Native AOT by adding &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PublishAot&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/PublishAot&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to our csproj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TFM&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;AOT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;App Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Publish duration&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net7.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;88.4MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;3.9 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;90.9MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;3.9 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net7.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;40MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;71.7 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;12.6MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;22.7 sec&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like with trimming, we can test the &lt;code&gt;WebApplication&lt;/code&gt; APIs that have less defaults enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TFM&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Builder&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;App Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Create&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;12.6MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Slim&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;8.8MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Empty&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;5.7MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;net8.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Empty+Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;7.8MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool! A small net8.0 app is 90.9MB and when published as Native AOT it&amp;#8217;s 12.6MB, or as low as 7.8MB (assuming we want a server, which we probably do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#8217;s take a look at some other performance characteristics of a Native AOT app; startup speed, memory usage, and RPS.
In order to properly show E2E benchmark numbers we need to use a multi-machine setup so that the server and client processes don&amp;#8217;t steal CPU from each other and we don&amp;#8217;t have random processes running like you would for a local machine. I&amp;#8217;ll be using our internal benchmarking infrastructure that makes use of the benchmarking tool &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/crank/"&gt;crank&lt;/a&gt; and our aspnet-citrine-win and aspnet-citrine-lin machines for server and load respectively. Both machine specs are described in our benchmarks &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/blob/a0577e58595b665d8e33a765991e6db71ab4ba9e/scenarios/README.md#profiles"&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, I&amp;#8217;ll be using an &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/tree/a0577e58595b665d8e33a765991e6db71ab4ba9e/src/BenchmarksApps/BasicMinimalApi"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; that uses Minimal APIs to return a json payload. This app uses the Slim builder we showed earlier as well as sets &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;InvariantGlobalization&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/InvariantGlobalization&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the csproj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we run the app without any extra settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;crank &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/scenarios/goldilocks.benchmarks.yml &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/build/ci.profile.yml &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/scenarios/steadystate.profile.yml &amp;#8211;scenario basicminimalapivanilla &amp;#8211;profile intel-win-app &amp;#8211;profile intel-lin-load &amp;#8211;application.framework net8.0 &amp;#8211;application.options.collectCounters true&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us a ~293ms startup time, 444MB working set, and ~762k RPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we run the same app but publish it as Native AOT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;crank &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/scenarios/goldilocks.benchmarks.yml &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/build/ci.profile.yml &amp;#8211;config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/main/scenarios/steadystate.profile.yml &amp;#8211;scenario basicminimalapipublishaot &amp;#8211;profile intel-win-app &amp;#8211;profile intel-lin-load &amp;#8211;application.framework net8.0 &amp;#8211;application.options.collectCounters true&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get ~67ms startup time, 56MB working set, and ~681k RPS.
That&amp;#8217;s ~77% faster startup speed, ~87% lower working set, and ~12% lower RPS. The startup speed is expected because the app has already been optimized, and there is no JIT running to start optimizing code. Also, in non-Native AOT apps, because startup methods are likely only called once, tiered compilation will never run on the startup methods so they won&amp;#8217;t be as optimized as they could be, but in NativeAOT the startup method will be fully optimized. The working set is a bit surprising, it is lower because Native AOT apps by default run with the new Dynamic Adaptation To Application Sizes (DATAS) GC. This GC setting tries to maintain a balance between throughput and overall memory usage, which we can see it doing with an ~87% lower working set at the cost of some RPS. You can read more about the new GC setting in &lt;a href="https://maoni0.medium.com/dynamically-adapting-to-application-sizes-2d72fcb6f1ea"&gt;Maoni0&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s also compare the Native AOT vs. non-Native AOT apps with the Server GC. So we&amp;#8217;ll add &lt;code&gt;--application.environmentVariables DOTNET_GCDynamicAdaptationMode=0&lt;/code&gt; when running the Native AOT app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we get ~64ms startup time, 403MB working set, and ~730k RPS. The startup time is still extremely fast because changing the GC doesn&amp;#8217;t affect that, our working set is closer to the non-Native AOT app but smaller due in part to not having the JIT compiler loaded and running, and our RPS is closer to the non-Native AOT app because we&amp;#8217;re using the Server GC which optimizes throughput more than memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;AOT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;GC&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Startup&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Working Set&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;RPS&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;293ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;444MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;762k&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;DATAS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;303ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;77MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;739k&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;64ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;403MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;730k&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;DATAS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;67ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;56MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;681k&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-Native AOT apps have the JIT optimizing code while it&amp;#8217;s running, and starting in .NET 8 the JIT by default will make use of dynamic PGO, this is a really cool feature that Native AOT isn&amp;#8217;t able to benefit from and is one reason non-Native AOT apps can have more throughput than Native AOT apps. You can read more about dynamic PGO in the &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#tiering-and-dynamic-pgo"&gt;.NET 8 performance blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re willing to trade some publish size for potentially more optimized code you can pass &lt;code&gt;/p:OptimizationPreference=Speed&lt;/code&gt; when building and publishing your Native AOT app. When we do this for our benchmark app (with Server GC) we get a publish size of 9.5MB instead of 8.9MB and 745k RPS instead of 730k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app we&amp;#8217;ve been using makes use of Minimal APIs which by default isn&amp;#8217;t trim friendly. It does a lot of reflection and dynamic code generation that isn&amp;#8217;t statically analyzable so the trimmer isn&amp;#8217;t able to safely trim the app. So why don&amp;#8217;t we see warnings when we Native AOT publish this app? Because we wrote a source-generator called Request Delegate Generator (RDG) that replaces your &lt;code&gt;MapGet&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MapPost&lt;/code&gt;, etc. methods with trim friendly code. This source-generator is automatically used for ASP.NET Core apps when trimming/aot publishing. Which leads us into the next section where we dive into RDG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="request-delegate-generator"&gt;Request Delegate Generator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Request Delegate Generator (RDG) is a &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview"&gt;source-generator&lt;/a&gt; created to make &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/overview"&gt;Minimal APIs&lt;/a&gt; trimmer and Native AOT friendly. Without RDG, using Minimal APIs will result in many warnings and your app likely won&amp;#8217;t work as expected. Here is a quick example to show an endpoint that will result in an exception when using Native AOT without RDG but will work with RDG enabled (or when not using Native AOT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;app.MapGet("/test", (Bindable b) =&amp;gt; "Hello world!");

public class Bindable
{
    public static ValueTask&amp;lt;Bindable?&amp;gt; BindAsync(HttpContext context, ParameterInfo parameter)
    {
        return new ValueTask&amp;lt;Bindable?&amp;gt;(new Bindable());
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This app throws when you send a &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request to &lt;code&gt;/test&lt;/code&gt; because the &lt;code&gt;Bindable.BindAsync&lt;/code&gt; method is referenced via reflection and so the trimmer can&amp;#8217;t statically figure out that the method is being used and will remove it. Minimal APIs then sees the &lt;code&gt;MapGet&lt;/code&gt; call as needing a request body which isn&amp;#8217;t allowed by default for &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; calls.
Besides fixings warnings and making the app work as expected in Native AOT, we get improved first response time and reduced publish size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without RDG, the first time a request is made to the app is when all the expression trees are generated for all endpoints in the application. Because RDG generates the source for an endpoint at compile time, there is no expression tree generation needed, the code for a specific endpoint is already available and can execute immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/tree/a0577e58595b665d8e33a765991e6db71ab4ba9e/src/BenchmarksApps/BasicMinimalApi"&gt;app used earlier&lt;/a&gt; for benchmarking AOT and look at time to first request we get ~187ms when not running as AOT and without RDG. We then get ~130ms when we enable RDG. When publishing as AOT, the time to first request is ~60ms regardless of using RDG. But this app only has 2 endpoints, so let&amp;#8217;s add 1000 more endpoints and see the difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Routes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="width: 12.8534%;"&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id="runtime-apis"&gt;Runtime APIs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section we&amp;#8217;ll be looking at changes that mainly involve updating to use new APIs introduced in .NET 8 in the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/glossary#bcl"&gt;Base Class Library (BCL)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="searchvalues"&gt;SearchValues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/45300"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#45300&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://github.com/gfoidl"&gt;@gfoidl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/47459"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#47459&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49114"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#49114&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49117"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#49117&lt;/a&gt; all make use of the new &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; type which lets these code paths take advantage of optimized search implementations for the specific values being searched for. The &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; section of the &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#searchvalues"&gt;.NET 8 performance blog&lt;/a&gt; explains more details about the different search algorithms used and why this type is so cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="spans"&gt;Spans&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46098"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46098&lt;/a&gt; makes use of the new &lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions.Split(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; source, Span&amp;lt;Range&amp;gt; destination, char separator)&lt;/code&gt; method. This allows certain cases of &lt;code&gt;string.Split(...)&lt;/code&gt; to be replaced with a non-allocating version. This saves the &lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt; allocation as well as the individual &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; allocations for the items in the &lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;. More details on this new API can be seen in the &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#spans"&gt;.NET 8 Performance post span section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="frozendictionary"&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new type introduced is &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt;. This allows constructing a dictionary optimized for read operations at the cost of slower construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/49714"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#49714&lt;/a&gt; switches a &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt; in routing to use &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt;. This dictionary is used when routing an http request to the appropriate endpoint which is almost every request to an application. The following tables show the cost of creating the dictionary vs. frozen dictionary, and then the cost of using a dictionary vs. frozen dictionary respectively. You can see that constructing a &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt; can be up to 13x slower, but the overall time is still in the micro second range (1/1000th of a millisecond) and the &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt; is only constructed once for the app. What we all like to see is that the per operation performance of using &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/code&gt; is 2.5x-3.5x faster than a &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;FrozenDictionary&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;8.516 ns&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.1337 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other"&gt;Other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is a compilation of changes that enhance performance but do not fall under any of the preceding categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="regex"&gt;Regex&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the AOT effort, we noticed the regex created in &lt;code&gt;RegexRouteConstraint&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-7.0#route-constraints"&gt;route constraints&lt;/a&gt; for more info) was adding ~1MB to the published app size. This is because the route constraints are dynamic (application code defines them) and we were using the &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; constructor that accepts &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions&lt;/code&gt;. This meant the trimmer has to keep around all regex code that could potentially be used, including the &lt;code&gt;NonBacktracking&lt;/code&gt; engine which keeps ~.8MB of code. By adding &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.Compiled&lt;/code&gt; the trimmer can now see that the &lt;code&gt;NonBacktracking&lt;/code&gt; code will not be used and it can reduce the application size by ~.8MB. Additionally, using compiled regexes is faster than using the interpreted regex. The quick fix was to just add &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.Compiled&lt;/code&gt; when creating the &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; which was done in &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46192"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46192&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://github.com/eugeneogongo"&gt;@eugeneogongo&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is that this slows down app startup because we resolve constraints when starting the app and compiled regexes are slower to construct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/46323"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#46323&lt;/a&gt; fixes this by lazily initializing the regexes so app startup is actually faster than 7.0 when we weren&amp;#8217;t using compiled regexes. It also added caching to the route constraints which means if you share constraints in multiple routes you will save allocations by sharing constraints across routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a microbenchmark for the route builder to measure startup performance shows an almost 450% improvement when using 1000 routes due to no longer initializing the regexes.
The benchmark lives &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/8279d3f8ee47d5e249ef12a99e4d1cacfd5209ec/src/Http/Routing/perf/Microbenchmarks/Matching/CreateMatcherRegexConstraintBenchmark.cs#L29"&gt;in the dotnet/aspnetcore repo&lt;/a&gt;. It has a lot of setup code and would be a bit too long to put in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before with interpreted regexes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="width: 26.8514%;"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 11.3553%;"&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 13.7363%;"&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 8.60806%;"&gt;Op/s&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 12.2711%;"&gt;Gen 0&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 9.34066%;"&gt;Gen 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="width: 13.7363%; text-align: right;"&gt;Allocated&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="width: 11.3553%;"&gt;Build&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 13.7363%;"&gt;6.739 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 8.60806%;"&gt;148.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 12.2711%;"&gt;15.6250&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 9.34066%;"&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 13.7363%;"&gt;7 MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After with compiled and lazy regexes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="width: 26.8503%;"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 11.3553%;"&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 13.7363%;"&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 8.79121%;"&gt;Op/s&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 10.6227%;"&gt;Gen 0&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 10.6227%;"&gt;Gen 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="width: 13.9194%; text-align: right;"&gt;Allocated&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="width: 11.3553%;"&gt;Build&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 13.7363%;"&gt;1.521 ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 8.79121%;"&gt;657.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 10.6227%;"&gt;5.8594&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 10.6227%;"&gt;1.9531&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 13.9194%;"&gt;2 MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Regex improvement came from &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44770"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44770&lt;/a&gt; which switched a Regex usage in routing to use the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-source-generators"&gt;Regex Source Generator&lt;/a&gt;. This moves the cost of compiling the Regex to build time, as well as resulting in faster Regex code due to optimizations the source generator takes advantage of that the in-process Regex compiler does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll show a simplified example that demonstrates using the generated regex vs. the compiled regex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public partial class AlphaRegex
{
    static Regex Net7Constraint = new Regex(
            @"^[a-z]*$",
            RegexOptions.CultureInvariant | RegexOptions.Compiled | RegexOptions.IgnoreCase,
            TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));

    static Regex Net8Constraint = GetAlphaRouteRegex();

    [GeneratedRegex(@"^[A-Za-z]*$")]
    private static partial Regex GetAlphaRouteRegex();

    [Benchmark(Baseline = true)]
    public bool CompiledRegex()
    {
        return Net7Constraint.IsMatch("Administration") &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Net7Constraint.IsMatch("US");
    }

    [Benchmark]
    public bool SourceGenRegex()
    {
        return Net8Constraint.IsMatch("Administration") &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Net8Constraint.IsMatch("US");
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Error&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;StdDev&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CompiledRegex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;86.92 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.572 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.447 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SourceGenRegex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;57.81 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.860 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.805 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;0.66&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id="analyzers"&gt;Analyzers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzers are useful for pointing out issues in code that can be hard to convey in API signatures, suggesting code patterns that are more readable, and they can also suggest more performant ways to write code. &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44799"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44799&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44791"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44791&lt;/a&gt; both from &lt;a href="https://github.com/martincostello"&gt;@martincostello&lt;/a&gt; enabled &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1854"&gt;CA1854&lt;/a&gt; which helps avoid 2 dictionary lookups when only 1 is needed, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44269"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44269&lt;/a&gt; enables a bunch of analyzers many of which help use more performant APIs and are described in more detail in last years &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance_improvements_in_net_7/#analyzers"&gt;.NET 7 Performance Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would encourage developers who are interested in performance in their own products to checkout &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/performance-warnings"&gt;performance focused analyzers&lt;/a&gt; which contains a list of many analyzers that will help avoid easy to fix performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="stringbuilder"&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; is an extremely useful class for constructing a string when you either can&amp;#8217;t precompute the size of the string to create or want an easy way to construct a string without the complications involved with using &lt;code&gt;string.Create(...)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; comes with a lot of helpful methods as well as a custom implementation of an &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/interpolated-string-handler"&gt;InterpolatedStringHandler&lt;/a&gt;. What this means is that you can &amp;#8220;create&amp;#8221; strings to add to the &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; without actually allocating the string. For example, previously you might have written &lt;code&gt;stringBuilder.Append(FormattableString.Invariant($"{key} = {value}"));&lt;/code&gt;. This would have allocated a string via &lt;code&gt;FormattableString.Invariant(...)&lt;/code&gt; then put it in the &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt;s internal &lt;code&gt;char[]&lt;/code&gt; buffer, making the string a temporary allocation. Instead you can write &lt;code&gt;stringBuilder.Append(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, $"{key} = {value}");&lt;/code&gt;. This also looks like it would allocate a string via &lt;code&gt;$"{key} = {value}"&lt;/code&gt;, but because &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; has a custom &lt;code&gt;InterpolatedStringHandler&lt;/code&gt; the string isn&amp;#8217;t actually allocated and instead is written directly to the internal &lt;code&gt;char[]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/44691"&gt;dotnet/aspnetcore#44691&lt;/a&gt; fixes some usage patterns with &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; to avoid allocations as well as makes use of the &lt;code&gt;InterpolatedStringHandler&lt;/code&gt; overload(s).
One specific example was taking a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; and converting it into a string in hexidecimal format so we could send it as a query string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;[MemoryDiagnoser]
public class AppendBenchmark
{
    private byte[] _b = new byte[30];

    [GlobalSetup]
    public void Setup()
    {
        RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(_b);
    }

    [Benchmark]
    public string AppendToString()
    {
        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        foreach (var b in _b)
        {
            sb.Append(b.ToString("x2", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture));
        }
        return sb.ToString();
    }

    [Benchmark]
    public string AppendInterpolated()
    {
        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        foreach (var b in _b)
        {
            sb.Append(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, $"{b:x2}");
        }
        return sb.ToString();
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table style="width: 18.8464%;"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="width: 43.6031%;"&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 19.5822%;"&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 15.9269%;"&gt;Gen0&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right; width: 20.8877%;"&gt;Allocated&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="width: 43.6031%;"&gt;AppendToString&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 19.5822%;"&gt;748.7 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 15.9269%;"&gt;0.1841&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 20.8877%;"&gt;1448 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="width: 43.6031%;"&gt;AppendInterpolated&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 19.5822%;"&gt;739.7 ns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 15.9269%;"&gt;0.0620&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right; width: 20.8877%;"&gt;488 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

**总结：**
文章介绍了DC-SCM（数据中心安全控制模块）在服务器设计中的作用和重要性。DC-SCM的引入将基板管理控制器（BMC）和相关组件从服务器主板上解耦，并在更小的模块中进行集成。这样做的好处包括降低PCB成本、实现灵活的模块化设计以满足不同客户需求、统一的OpenBMC固件开发，以及提高服务器管理和安全硬件升级的效率。Cloudflare与Lenovo的合作项目Project Argus是其DC-SCM的具体实施，为服务器行业提供了标准化的管理、安全和控制功能。通过使用DC-SCM，Cloudflare的下一代服务器将获得更强大的管理和安全性能。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="905" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Project-Argus-DC-SCM.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, data center servers have used motherboards that included all key components on a single circuit board. The DC-SCM (Datacenter-ready Secure Control Module) decouples server management and security functions from a traditional server motherboard, enabling development of server management and security solutions independent of server architecture. It also provides opportunities for reducing server printed circuit board (PCB) material cost, and allows unified firmware images to be developed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Cloudflare is announcing that it has partnered with Lenovo to design a DC-SCM for our next-generation servers. The design specification has been published to the OCP (Open Compute Project) contribution database under the name &lt;a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/cloudfare-lenovo-project-argus-dc-scm2-0-module-design-spec-rev1-0-pdf"&gt;Project Argus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-brief-introduction-to-baseboard-management-controllers"&gt;A brief introduction to baseboard management controllers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baseboard management controller (BMC) is a specialized processor that can be found in virtually every server product. It allows remote access to the server through a network connection, and provides a rich set of server management features. Some of the commonly used BMC features include server power management, device discovery, sensor monitoring, remote firmware update, system event logging, and error reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical server design, the BMC resides on the server motherboard, along with other key components such as the processor, memory, CPLD and so on. This was the norm for generations of server products, but that has changed in recent years as motherboards are increasingly optimized for high-speed signal bandwidth, and servers need to support specialized security requirements. This has made it necessary to decouple the BMC and its related components from the server motherboard, and move them to a smaller common form factor module known as the Datacenter Secure Control Module (DC-SCM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 is a picture of a motherboard used on Cloudflare’s previous generation of edge servers. The BMC and its related circuit components are placed on the same printed circuit board as the host CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="1327" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Figure-1.png" width="1489" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: Previous Generation Server Motherboard&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Cloudflare’s next generation of edge servers, we are partnering with Lenovo to create a DC-SCM based design. On the left-hand side of Figure 2 is the printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) for the Host Processor Module (HPM). It hosts the CPU, the memory slots, and other components required for the operation and features of the server design. But the BMC and its related circuits have been relocated to a separate PCBA, which is the DC-SCM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="863" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Figure-2.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: Next Generation HPM and DC-SCM&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-dc-scm-based-server-design"&gt;Benefits of DC-SCM based server design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="pcb-cost-reduction"&gt;PCB cost reduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of today, DDR5 memory runs at 6400MT/s (mega transfers per second). In the future DDR5 speed may even increase to 7200MT/s or 8800MT/s. Meanwhile, PCIe Gen5 is running at 32 GT/s (giga transfers per second), doubling the speed rate of PCIe Gen4. Both DDR5 and PCIE Gen5 are key interfaces for the processors used on our next-generation servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing rates of high-speed IO signals and memory buses are pushing the next generation of server motherboard designs to transition from low-loss to ultra-low loss dielectric printed circuit board (PCB) materials, and higher layer counts in the PCB. At the same time, the speed of BMC and its related circuitry are not progressing so quickly. For example, the physical layer interface of ASPEED AST2600 BMC is only at PCIe Gen2 (5 GT/s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low loss dielectric PCB material and higher PCB layer count are both driving factors for higher PCB cost. Another driving factor of PCB cost is the size of the PCB. In a traditional server motherboard design, the size of the server motherboard is larger, since the BMC and its related circuits are placed on the same PCB as the host CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By decoupling the BMC and its related circuitry from the host processor module (HPM), we can reduce the size of the relatively more expensive PCB for the HPM. BMC and its related circuitry can be placed on relatively cheaper PCB, with reduced layer count and lossier PCB dielectric materials. For example, in the design of Cloudflare’s next generation of servers, the server motherboard PCB needs to be 14 or more layers, whereas the BMC and its related components can be easily routed with 8 or 10 layers of PCB. In addition, the dielectric material used on DC-SCM PCB is low-loss dielectric — another cost saver compared to ultra-low loss dielectric materials used on HPM PCB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="modularized-design-enables-flexibility"&gt;Modularized design enables flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DC-SCM modularizes server management and security components into a common add-in card form factor, enabling developers to remove customer specific solutions from the more complex components, such as motherboards, to the DC-SCM. This provides flexibility for developers to offer multiple customer-specific solutions, without the need to redesign multiple motherboards for each solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers are able to reuse the DC-SCM from a previous generation of server design, if the management and security requirements remain the same. This reduces the overall cost of upgrading to a new generation of servers, and has the potential to reduce e-waste when a server is decommissioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, management and security solution upgrades within a server generation can be carried out separately by modifying or replacing the DC-SCM. The more complex components on the HPM do not need to be redesigned. From a data center perspective, it speeds up the upgrade of management and security hardware across multiple server platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="unified-interoperable-openbmc-firmware-development"&gt;Unified interoperable OpenBMC firmware development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data center secure control interface (DC-SCI) is a standardized hardware interface between DC-SCM and the Host Processor Module (HPM). It provides a basis for electrical interoperability between different DC-SCM and host processor module (HPM) designs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interoperability makes it possible to have a unified firmware image across multiple DC-SCM designs, concentrating development resources on a single firmware rather than an array of them. The publicly-accessible &lt;a href="https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc"&gt;OpenBMC repository&lt;/a&gt; provides a perfect platform for firmware developers of different companies to collaborate and develop such unified OpenBMC images. Instead of maintaining a separate BMC firmware image for each platform, we now use a single image that can be applied across multiple server platforms. The device tree specific to each respective server is automatically loaded based on device product information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a unified OpenBMC image significantly simplifies the process of releasing BMC firmware to multiple server platforms. Firmware updates and changes are propagated to all supported platforms in a single firmware release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="project-argus"&gt;Project Argus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DC-SCM specifications have been driven by the Open Compute Project (OCP) Foundation hardware management workstream, as a way to standardize server management, security, and control features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has partnered with Lenovo on what we call Project Augus, Cloudflare’s first DC-SCM implementation that fully adheres to the &lt;a href="https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Hardware_Management/Hardware_Management_Module"&gt;DC-SCM 2.0 specification&lt;/a&gt;. In the DC-SCM 2.0 specifications, a few design items are left open for implementers to decide on the most suitable architectural choices. With the goal of improving interoperability of Cloudflare DC-SCM designs across server vendors and server designs, Project Argus includes documentation on implementation details and design decisions on form factor, mechanical locking mechanism, faceplate design, DC-SCI pin out, BMC chip, BMC pinout, Hardware Root of Trust (HWRoT), HWRoT pinout, and minimum bootable device tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="1600" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Figure-3.png" width="1139" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: Project Argus DC-SCM 2.0&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the Project Argus DC-SCM is the ASPEED AST2600 BMC System on Chip (SoC), which when loaded with a compatible OpenBMC firmware, provides a rich set of common features necessary for remote server management. ASPEED AST1060 is used on Project Argus DC-SCM as the HWRoT solution, providing secure firmware authentication, firmware recovery, and firmware update capability. Project Argus DC-SCM 2.0 uses Lattice MachXO3D CPLD with secure boot and dual boot ability as the DC-SCM CPLD to support a variety of IO interfaces including LTPI, SGPIO, UART and GPIOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanical form factor of Project Argus DC-SCM 2.0 is the horizontal External Form Factor (EFF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare and Lenovo have contributed &lt;a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/cloudfare-lenovo-project-argus-dc-scm2-0-module-design-spec-rev1-0-pdf"&gt;Project Argus Design Specification&lt;/a&gt; and reference design files to the &lt;a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/9e2b0d227655c9ea04414626aa958a72a913f315-zip"&gt;OCP contribution database&lt;/a&gt;. Below is a detailed list of our contribution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SPI, I2C/I3C, UART, LTPI/SGPIO block diagrams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DC-SCM PCB stackup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DC-SCM Board placements (TOP and BOTTOM layers)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DC-SCM schematic PDF file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DC-SCI pin definition PDF file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Power sequence PDF file&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DC-SCM bill of materials Excel spreadsheet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimum bootable device tree requirements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Drawings PDF files, including card assembly drawing and interlock rail drawing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-security-foundation-for-our-gen-12-hardware"&gt;The security foundation for our Gen 12 hardware&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has been innovating around &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/hardware/"&gt;server design&lt;/a&gt; for many years, delivering increased performance per watt and reduced carbon footprints. We are excited to integrate Project Argus DC-SCM 2.0 into our next-generation, Cloudflare Gen 12 servers. Stay tuned for more exciting updates on Cloudflare Gen 12 hardware design!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

By analyzing information about individuals, businesses can gain crucial insights to improve talent development, enhance employee experiences, and streamline human resources processes. The application of analytics to people data empowers organizations to harness the full potential of their most important asset: their people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HR/People data contains information about employees of the company and the candidate pipelines. The information is highly sensitive with fields containing attributes such as race/ethnicity, sexual orientation etc. Hence, People Insights Infrastructure is built w/ &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; as the focal point.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gusto uses &lt;code&gt;Workday&lt;/code&gt; as HRIS, Greenhouse as the choice for &lt;code&gt;ATS&lt;/code&gt; (Applicant Tracking System), &lt;code&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/code&gt; as the survey tool, &lt;code&gt;Degreed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LearnUpon&lt;/code&gt; for learning and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help with this, we have adopted &lt;a href="https://www.onemodel.co/blog/the-end-of-the-snapshot-workday-edition?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One Model&amp;apos;s People Data Cloud platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for its capabilities in extracting and modeling HR data sources. It is used specifically for its Greenhouse and Workday integration.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://deepnote.com/?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deepnote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is utilized for end-to-end data pipelines (ELTs) involving Degreed, LearnUpon, and Qualtrics. We also create denormalized tables on top of OneModels output schema, stored in a Redshift cluster hosted on OneModels AWS account. Tableau is employed as the front-end to develop insightful dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="workday-integration-employee-data"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workday Integration [Employee data]:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="application-of-employee-data"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application of employee data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce planning dashboard:&lt;/strong&gt; helps in headcount planning by utilizing the employee hiring, terminations and movement. Integration of data points -&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;employees who have accepted the offer but have a future start date - &lt;code&gt;Accepted Not Started&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Open Requisitions&lt;/code&gt; across &lt;code&gt;MoM&lt;/code&gt;aids in a single source of truth for workforce planning and forecasting.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data Feeds to Finance partners helps them run forecasts on the cost of talent($).&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Science:&amp;#xa0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study, develop and publish research on drivers of employee turnover, performance and promotion.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publish internal research around pay equity and adverse impact.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gusto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gustos-2021-RISE-Report-1.pdf?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;external&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reporting requirements of any RISE+ parameter combinations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory reporting:&amp;#xa0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DFEH: &lt;a href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/paydatareporting/?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;California Pay Data Reporting | CRD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EEO: &lt;a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/data/eeo-data-collections?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;EEO Data Collections | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="technical-architecture"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Architecture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="Data Engineering on People Data" class="kg-image" height="239" src="https://engineering.gusto.com/content/images/2023/10/OneModel_Workday_Connector.png" width="605" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Two Types of Connection between Workday and OneModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workday is built with an object-oriented approach. &lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt; objects can be queried via direct API calls and &lt;strong&gt;custom&lt;/strong&gt; objects via Reporting-as-a Service (RaaS).&amp;#xa0; &lt;code&gt;RaaS&lt;/code&gt; is a feature that exposes reports as web service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="greenhouse-integration-candidate-application-data"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenhouse Integration [Candidate &amp;amp; Application data]:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="applicationbusiness-impact"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application/Business Impact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talent lifecycle: understanding the lifecycle of a candidate applying for a role at Gusto at each stage : application &amp;#x2192; interviewing &amp;#x2192; offer &amp;#x2192; conversion to an employee in workday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean and robust recruiting data helps us inform the common &lt;a href="https://www.greenhouse.com/resources/glossary/what-are-recruitment-kpis?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;KPIs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which provides us strategic insights on sourcing, offers and overall pipeline health. Thus, able to calculate recruiting efficiency and pipeline health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="technical-architecture-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Architecture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id="greenhouse-connector-combination-of-api-calls-is-available-within-onemodel-to-extract-all-the-necessary-endpoints"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004626411-One-Model-integration?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greenhouse connector&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (combination of API calls) is available within OneModel to extract all the necessary endpoints.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For modeling the data within One Model, we are using an Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) approach where modeled tables are stored in &lt;code&gt;One&lt;/code&gt; Schema. Then we are able to build denormalized/reporting tables by writing business logic and transformation on top of One schema to build &lt;em&gt;people insights&lt;/em&gt; schema, which is the source of truth for data science, analytics reporting &amp;amp; tableau data sources.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="security-enhancements"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security enhancements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full access to the People Data Warehouse (PDW) is restricted to the People Insights team and the OneModel vendor and is IP restricted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;External reporting teams have a service account to Redshift to pull non-sensitive data from the &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; database schema. [Limited access]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PGP encryption service helps to encrypt the outbound data feeds.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For visualization and building scalable dashboards, we utilize Tableau. In Tableau, we have automated &lt;a href="https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/scim_config_online.htm?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;managing the user permissions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by setting up user groups in workday (source system), which flows through Okta (for authentication) to reach Azure Active Directory (Identity Provider). Tableau server syncs groups every ~30 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps our team to directly leverage the groups in Tableau and immune us against the possibility of &lt;strong&gt;manual&lt;/strong&gt; errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ex: Transfer scenario: if an employee moves from People to Product, they would need to be adjusted manually within a group in tableau for the access level. This has the risk of &lt;strong&gt;unauthorized access.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These groups also serve as google groups within Gmail. This helps us be in sync with the single definition of each group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="Data Engineering on People Data" class="kg-image" height="191" src="https://engineering.gusto.com/content/images/2023/10/Indentity-Access-Management--Tableau-.png" width="634" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;Identity Access Management for Tableau&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="idiosyncratic-scenarios-evergreen-requisitions-in-greenhouse"&gt;Idiosyncratic scenarios: &lt;strong&gt;Evergreen requisitions in Greenhouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each organization has &lt;a href="https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/4402883414811-Evergreen-jobs-and-HRIS-integrations?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;evergreen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; requisitions (ex: software engineering role for tech company) which runs throughout the year. However, there is no capability of connecting these roles in Greenhouse &amp;#x2190;&amp;#x2192; Workday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine, a candidate interviewing for multiple roles (at least one of them being evergreen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;reaching the offer stage for one of them in the greenhouse. At this point, we have multiple applications per candidate.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, we don&amp;#x2019;t know which one to use for calculating funnel metrics (such as &lt;code&gt;pass-through rate&lt;/code&gt;) if both applications with evergreen req are not mapped to workday. This results in skewed data points.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with OneModel, we have built an algorithm that inferences the headcount requisition which are disconnected from application with ~94% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration for following data sources are written end-to-end in &lt;a href="https://deepnote.com/?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deepnote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which provides us the ability to have a separate account for people insights team. This helps us to keep our codebase and data private.&amp;#xa0; Key feature which helps us in data pipelines is the interoperability between python and SQL in Deepnote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jobs on qualtrics drop the result of different surveys into internal SFTP, which is picked up by the data pipeline written in Deepnote to transform and write as tables within the redshift schema. This helps our team to measure the impact of any people program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LearnUpon [via &lt;a href="https://docs.learnupon.com/api/?ref=engineering.gusto.com#learnupon-technical-documentation"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x2192; data pipeline in DN]&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application:&amp;#xa0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measure any learning and development program&amp;#x2019;s effectiveness. Dashboard for managers to evaluate completion rates for courses assigned to their directs in real-time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Degreed [via FTP &amp;#x2192; data pipeline in DN]&amp;#xa0;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Degreed drops flat files into the FTP drive, which is picked up by the job running on deepnote to clean, parse and persist the data into redshift tables. We use the ELT approach for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upleveling our infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, we have built cross-account connections between three AWS accounts to ingest the data from enterprise data warehouse and write into people data warehouse. We can leverage&amp;#xa0; &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY.html?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;COPY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_UNLOAD.html?ref=engineering.gusto.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UNLOAD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; commands to optimize the performance of writing into S3 and Redshift cluster.&amp;#xa0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gusto continues to evolve and expand, the growth of our employee, candidate, and application data is inevitable. Constant enhancements to the scalability of our systems, data pipelines, and algorithms are necessary to build efficient tools that enable self-service access to this valuable data, while ensuring that data privacy remains a top priority as well as driving informed decision-making across the organization. Our People Insights infrastructure architecture excels in security-focused batch processing and scalability for integrating new data sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

本文介绍了上周的一些重要发布内容和新功能，主要涉及Amazon EBS、AWS Systems Manager、Amazon EC2、Amazon Textract和Amazon OpenSearch Service等服务。同时还列举了其他一些值得关注的AWS新闻和博客文章，并提到了即将发生的AWS活动。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;With just 41 days until &lt;a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/"&gt;AWS re:Invent&lt;/a&gt; 2023 opens, I’m doing my best to stay heads-down and focused on working with the entire AWS News Blog team to create plenty of awesome new posts for your reading pleasure! I’ll take a short break this morning to share some of the most exciting launches and other news from last week. Here we go!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Week’s Launches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here are some of the launches that captured my attention:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon EBS&lt;/strong&gt; – The new &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-cloudwatch-metric-monitors-reachability-ebs-volumes/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attached EBS Status Check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CloudWatch metric lets you monitor the status of all of the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/"&gt;Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)&lt;/a&gt; volumes attached to a particular &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"&gt;Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)&lt;/a&gt; instance, verifying that the volumes are reachable and able to complete I/O operations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Systems Manager&lt;/strong&gt; – You can now &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/enable-aws-systems-manager-ec2-instances-organization/"&gt;enable AWS Systems Manager by default&lt;/a&gt; for all EC2 instances within an Organization. This lets you confirm that core Systems Manager capabilities are present on all new and existing instances.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon EC2&lt;/strong&gt; – You can now &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-ec2-amis-disabled-state/"&gt;set unused or obsolete AMIs to a disabled state&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the AMI private if it was previously shared, hides it from&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html"&gt; DescribeImages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; by default, and prevents new instances from being launched from it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Textract&lt;/strong&gt; – You can now use &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-textract-custom-queries-information-extraction-business-specific-documents/"&gt;Custom Queries&lt;/a&gt; to adapt Textract’s Queries feature to improve extraction accuracy for business-specific documents. You upload sample documents, label the data, and generate an adapter, which you then use in calls to the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_AnalyzeDocument.html"&gt;AnalyzeDocument&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon OpenSearch Service&lt;/strong&gt; – You can now &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/aws-search-pipelines-opensearch/"&gt;create Search Pipelines&lt;/a&gt; for easier processing of queries and results. Each &lt;a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/index/"&gt;search pipeline&lt;/a&gt; can contain multiple processing steps: query rewriters, natural language processors, result rerankers, and filters; several &lt;a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/search-processors/"&gt;standard processors&lt;/a&gt; are also included.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Linux 2&lt;/strong&gt; – The latest quarterly release (AL2023.2) of &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/"&gt;Amazon Linux 2&lt;/a&gt; includes a core set of &lt;a href="https://www.ansible.com/"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; features as well as a curated set of community collections. It also includes &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/09/amazon-corretto-21-generally-available/"&gt;Amazon Corretto 21&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2023/release-notes/relnotes.html"&gt;many other new features&lt;/a&gt; and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Rekognition&lt;/strong&gt; – You can now &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/accuracy-pre-trained-rekognition-moderation-model-custom-moderation/"&gt;train custom adapters&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the number of false positives and false negative flagged by &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/"&gt;Amazon Rekognition&lt;/a&gt;, giving you the power to tailor the deep learning model to improve performance for your specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;

**总结：**

Amazon EC2推出了新型实例R7i，这是针对内存优化的实例，采用了定制的第四代Intel Xeon Scalable处理器，提供了在云中最高的计算性能。R7i实例适用于各种内存密集型工作负载，并具有较大的规模和高吞吐量。此外，R7i实例还配备了内置的加速器，用于加速机器学习、数据处理和分析等任务。这些实例已经在多个AWS区域上线，并提供多种购买选项。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier, we introduced a duo of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to our lineup: the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-seventh-generation-general-purpose-amazon-ec2-instances-m7i-flex-and-m7i/"&gt;general-purpose Amazon EC2 M7i instances&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c7i"&gt;compute-optimized Amazon EC2 C7i instances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m happy to share that we’re expanding these seventh-generation x86-based offerings to include memory-optimized Amazon EC2 R7i instances. These instances are powered by custom 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (Sapphire Rapids) exclusive to AWS and will offer the highest compute performance among the comparable fourth-generation Intel processors in the cloud. The R7i instances are available in eleven sizes including two bare metal sizes (coming soon), and offer 15 percent improvement in price-performance compared to Amazon EC2 R6i instances.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2 R7i instances are SAP Certified and are an ideal fit for memory-intensive workloads such as high-performance databases (SQL and NoSQL databases), distributed web scale in-memory caches (Memcached and Redis), in-memory databases (SAP HANA), real-time big data analytics (Apache Hadoop and Spark clusters) and other enterprise applications. Amazon EC2 R7i offers larger instance sizes (48xlarge) with up to 192 vCPUs and 1,536 GiB of memory, including both virtual and bare metal instances, enabling you to consolidate your workloads and scale-up applications.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can attach up to 128 EBS volumes to each R7i instance; by way of comparison, the R6i instances allow you to attach up to 28 volumes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here are the specs for the R7i instances:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/tbody&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’re also getting ready to launch two sizes of bare metal R7i instances soon:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table cellpadding="8" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;"&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/tbody&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built-in Accelerators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Sapphire Rapids processors include four built-in accelerators, each providing hardware acceleration for a specific workload:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) &lt;/strong&gt;– The AMX extensions are designed to accelerate machine learning and other compute-intensive workloads that involve matrix operations. It improves the efficiency of these operations by providing specialized hardware instructions and registers tailored for matrix computations. Matrix operations, such as multiplication and convolution, are fundamental building blocks in various computational tasks, especially in machine learning algorithms.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA) &lt;/strong&gt;– DSA enhances data processing and analytics capabilities for a wide range of applications and enables developers to harness the full potential of their data-driven workloads. With DSA, you gain access to optimized hardware acceleration that delivers exceptional performance for data-intensive tasks.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (IAA) &lt;/strong&gt;– This accelerator runs database and analytic workloads faster, with the potential for greater power efficiency. In-memory compression, decompression, encryption at very high throughput, and a suite of analytics primitives support in-memory databases, open-source databases, and data stores like &lt;a href="https://rocksdb.org/"&gt;RocksDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clickhouse.com/"&gt;ClickHouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) &lt;/strong&gt;– This accelerator offloads encryption, decryption, and compression, freeing up processor cores and reducing power consumption. It also supports merged compression and encryption in a single data flow.

在本系列博客中的第一部分中，我们将展示如何使用最新的Cloudera Iceberg创新在私有云中构建Open Data Lakehouse。本文首先重点介绍了将流式数据注入到Open Data Lakehouse和Iceberg表中的过程。

解决方案概述：
在使用NiFi将数据流式注入到Iceberg表中之前，需要先安装和配置Cloudera Open Data Lakehouse的一些组件，并准备好航空公司数据集。

下一步：使用NiFi流式注入数据进入Iceberg表的步骤：
1. 在Hue/Impala中创建用于NiFi注入的routes Iceberg表。
2. 下载预先构建的流程定义文件。
3. 在NiFi中创建新的处理组并上传流程定义文件。
4. 更新参数。
5. 进入NiFiDemo处理组，启用控制器服务。
6. 启动Routes数据注入到Kafka流程，并监控成功/失败队列。
7. 启动Routes数据从Kafka到Iceberg流程，并监控成功/失败队列。
8. 在Hue/Impala中检查Routes Iceberg表以查看已加载的数据。

在这篇博客文章中，我们展示了如何使用Cloudera Flow Management（NiFi）直接将数据流式注入到Iceberg表中，无需编写任何代码。敬请关注第二部分，将介绍使用Apache Spark进行数据处理。

This release signified Cloudera’s vision of Iceberg everywhere. Customers can deploy Open Data Lakehouse wherever the data resides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;any public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud, and port workloads seamlessly across deployments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;With Cloudera Open Data Lakehouse in the private cloud, you can benefit from following key features:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-engine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; interoperability and compatibility with Apache Iceberg, including NiFi, Flink and SQL Stream Builder (SSB), Spark, and Impala.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time Travel:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Reproduce a query as of a given time or snapshot ID, which can be used for historical audits, validating ML models, and rollback of erroneous operations, as an example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table Rollback&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;: Allow users to quickly correct problems by resetting tables to a good state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rich set of SQL (query, DDL, DML) commands: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Create or manipulate database objects, run queries, load and modify data, perform time travel operations, and convert Hive external tables to Iceberg tables &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;using SQL commands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;In-place table (schema, partition) evolution: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Effortlessly evolve Iceberg table schema and partition layouts &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;without rewriting table data or migrating to a new table, for example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SDX Integration:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Provides common security and governance policies, as well as data lineage and auditing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Iceberg &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Replication: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Provides disaster recovery and table backups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easy portability of workloads&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; to public cloud and back without any code refactoring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this multi-part blog post, we’re going to show you how to use the latest Cloudera Iceberg innovation to build an Open Data Lakehouse on a private cloud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For this first part of the blog series we will focus on ingesting streaming data into the open data lakehouse and Iceberg tables making it available for further processing that we will demonstrate in the following blogs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Solution Overview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-146153 size-post-medium" height="320" src="https://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-16-at-1.48.35-PM-607x320.png" width="607" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Pre-requisites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The following components in Cloudera Open Data Lakehouse on Private Cloud should be installed and configured and airline data sets:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud/latest/release-summaries/topics/announcement-202309-719.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera Data Platform Private Cloud Base 7.1.9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cfm/2.1.6/index.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera Flow Management 2.1.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jingalls1217/airlines-source-data.git"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;https://github.com/jingalls1217/airlines-source-data.git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; (make sure to unzip the flights.csv.gzip file in the flights directory)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this example, we are going to use NiFi as part of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cfm/2.1.6/index.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;CFM 2.1.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; to stream ingest data sets to Iceberg. Please note, you can also leverage Flink and SQL Stream Builder in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/csa/latest/release-notes/topics/csa-what-new.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;CSA 1.11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; as well for streaming ingestion. We use NiFi to ingest an airport route data set (JSON) and send that data to Kafka and Iceberg. We then use Hue/Impala to take a look at the tables we created.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Please reference user documentation for installation and configuration of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud/latest/release-summaries/topics/announcement-202309-719.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera Data Platform Private Cloud Base 7.1.9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cfm/2.1.6/index.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera Flow Management 2.1.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Follow the steps below for using NiFi to stream ingest data into Iceberg tables:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;1- Create the routes Iceberg table for NiFi ingestion in Hue/Impala execute the following DDL:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <link>https://8thlight.com/insights/ensemble-programming-tips</link>
      <description>**关键词：**
- Ensemble programming (全体编程)
- Collaboration (协作)
- Teamwork (团队合作)
- Knowledge sharing (知识分享)
- Communication (沟通)

**大纲：**
1. Ensemble programming的实施方式和原则
2. Ensemble programming的优势和挑战
3. 影响团队成功的七个需求
    - 参与度
    - 日常工作流程
    - 借助他人的技能和经验
    - 减轻心理负担的方法
    - 知识分享的重要性
    - 对团队自主权的需求
    - 良好的沟通
4. Ensemble programming的总结

**总结：**
Ensemble programming是一种团队合作的软件开发方法，通过共享代码拥有权、知识分享和协作编程来实现团队成员之间的协作。它能够提高团队的工作效率和产出，并带来诸多优势，如更快的新人适应期、全员参与感和优化解决方案的能力。然而，它也存在挑战，如需要快速决策、难以深入研究感兴趣的领域和工作速度相对较慢。为了确保成功，团队需要关注参与度、日常工作流程、借用他人的技能和经验、减轻心理负担、知识分享、自主权和良好的沟通。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p class="txt-2xl font-semibold"&gt;Ensemble programming is a way for teams of developers to collaborate in real-time. A group usually consists of three to five developers. The group performs collaborative coding, all focusing on a single task at a time and benefits from collective knowledge to find the optimal working solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="body"&gt;I recently had the opportunity to perform software development in an ensemble and the experience helped me identify needs that were important for any type of team to flourish and excel. If this sounds like something that your team may benefit from, read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Our Implementation of Ensemble Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On this client, our team of five developers performed driver-navigator in rotations. One person is designated the initial driver, shares their screen, and implements the code changes directed by the navigator for a set period of time. Once that period of time is up, the driver becomes the next navigator. Another person is chosen as the driver and the process repeats until everyone has their turn. Then the rotation starts again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Each navigator is free to decide the direction for the next set of code changes, which sometimes picks up the changes from the previous navigator or changes directions completely, such as performing a refactor. The navigator gains help from the other team members on the call, if needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once a week, we perform spikes, where we could spend the afternoon researching a new tool, library, or idea that benefited the client in some way and then present the information to the team the next morning. If the team deemed the work beneficial, any code changes would require integration into the code base via ensemble programming. No code changes resulting from solo work were allowed to be merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Benefits of Ensemble Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Pooling knowledge means that teams find the optimal solution from the start. No time is wasted trying something new, submitting a PR, and then finding out that the team doesn’t agree with that implementation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;New team members have quick ramp up time. Because everyone is working together, new team members don’t need to spend time trying to understand a process before they can get started. They simply listen, learn, and participate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Everyone feels involved. I felt immediately part of the team from day one. It was very clear that we were all contributing, working together, and making progress — together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Challenges of Ensemble Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When making decisions, you need to respond very quickly. Some people take time to process information and come up with a valid counterargument. If you are in your head trying to understand an idea, it is quite possible the team has already decided and moved on before you chime in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Having everyone work together all the time means it is challenging to deep dive into an area that interests you. This is especially true for people who learn better by being hands-on-keyboard. I personally like to experiment and try different things to get a deeper understanding of how and why something works. There isn’t time for this during an ensemble. You can propose an idea but you decide on consensus and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Programming feels very slow. Everyone working together all the time means that you only work on one thing at a time. You can slice features into smaller slices to get things out faster, but they are still just smaller slices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;The 7 Needs of Successful Teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any programming approach, it's important to adapt to the team's needs. Here are some learnings our team took away from ensemble programming that can be applied to other teams or even other delivery approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;1. The Need for Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After the first week of ensemble, I felt extremely exhausted. As someone with introverted tendencies, the sheer amount of brain power and socializing skills I needed to exude to listen to four other people on a call for seven hours every day was more than I thought I could muster. Despite this challenge, I made sure to listen to every single person on the call, their insights, their coding techniques, and their questions. I also made sure to stay engaged as much as possible. I participated in the conversations, asked questions when I was confused and provided suggestions when people got stuck, even when I didn’t know the code base very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: Being engaged reduces ramp up time, helps to understand the culture and allows you to contribute to the work quickly. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;2. The Need for Routine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After a few weeks of ensemble, I noticed that some of the team members, including myself, were showing signs of burnout. It was hard for me to understand the task at hand, I was dreading the rest of the afternoon, and people who were neither driving nor navigating on the call were completely disengaged from the conversation. After some self-reflection and observation, I realized the source of the exhaustion. We would work for hours at a time, with no breaks, and blow past lunch without even realizing it. I can get hangry with the best of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After some discussions with the team, we tried a few different techniques to alleviate this issue. I found that the best version of the ensemble that our team practiced was by applying the pomodoro technique to our workflow. We would code for 50 minutes, take a 10-minute break, stop at noon for lunch (or as close to noon as possible), and then end the day on time. This became a more sustainable pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing a routine of taking breaks before exhaustion ensures the team has energy to keep going without compromising on pace or progress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;3. The Need to Phone a Friend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the benefits of ensemble programming is the ability to tap into the skillsets of the experts on your team. For example, we would have to create a new AWS lambda, or modify a Dynamo db schema, or figure out some strange UI refresh issue in our React Typescript front end. In all these cases, I never hesitated to navigate an issue that I was completely unfamiliar with because I had the ability to shoulder tap anyone on the team that was more familiar with the technology than I was. I would be in the middle of navigating a feature and pause to ask the Lambda expert what was the best AWS command to use, the Typescript expert why I couldn’t get something to compile or the Jest expert why my mock wasn’t working. I had immediate access to mentors and I made sure to leverage it. We made forward progress and I still learned a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;Leveraging the skills of the more experienced members on the team and getting near-immediate feedback makes people feel supported and keeps them productive.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;4. The Need to Offload Mental Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Our team handled sprint meetings with a daily call in the morning with the product manager, who gave us the direction of work for the day. Team members often stated, “We don’t have meetings but we can talk about anything, anytime.” However, during the ensemble, there was a balancing act between making progress and having conversations. Asking more questions meant the whole team had to stop and address the conversation. This was the same for concerns. I knew certain discussions would take a while and it would be nice to focus on getting something to prod that day instead. However, the mental load was still there — I kept thoughts in the back of my mind to find the right time to bring it up so that we would have effective conversations. These ended up taking space in my head that could otherwise be used for other focus tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On other projects I’ve been on, we would designate time for discussion topics, such as backlog grooming or retro. Retro allowed the opportunity to bring up concerns, discuss them with the team, and identify action items to address them. It was an opportunity to offload the mental task to a designated time and place. I didn’t have to talk about it now, because we would talk about it then. It also served as an opportunity for everyone’s concerns to be brought up, regardless of your working style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In this current project, a few months after joining the team, we finally held a retro which proved extremely insightful. A number of concerns were brought up and it made me realize that having a routine for these types of discussions was more valuable than expecting people to bring it up “anytime.” We decided to have retro once a month. Some teams will have retro at the end of every day for 15 minutes and others have it once a week. It is important for the team to discover what works for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;Reducing mental overhead by having designated space improves productivity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;5. The Need for Knowledge Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One interesting aspect of ensemble programming is that no one is singularly important. I know that is a strong statement and likely a huge ego blow. Let me clarify. Because everyone works on everything, siloing of information doesn’t occur. When someone left the team or went on a weeklong vacation, the team knew we would keep making progress. If I had a question, I could ask anyone else on the team for help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, certain people served as experts in certain areas because of their background and interests in certain technologies, but there was never a sense that we couldn’t work on a feature because someone was out and was the only one who knew how something worked. This was a huge benefit to the client and a huge weight off of developers’ shoulders because when they needed time off, they took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;Teams are more productive when access to useful information remains prevalent and clients benefit from not being bound to “sticky” team members.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;6. The Need for Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It was very normal for our team to try something new, stick with it if it worked and discard the idea if it didn’t. For example, we started with 20-minute driver/navigator sessions and found them to be too long. For our team, 5 minutes became the sweet spot. As another example, we initially used a kanban board to identify work tasks but it didn’t allow for ease of organization, so we switched to discovery trees. With this, we were able to identify the requirements more easily and align implementation with use cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a team, we made decisions that benefited the team without having to go through an approval process; the whole team was the approval process. When things didn’t work, we pivoted. We didn’t lose time being frustrated with a constraining process and a technology that didn’t benefit the teams’ or the client’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;Teams need to be able to make decisions that improve their productivity, protect their mental health, and secure their ability to make forward progress.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;7. The Need for Good Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ensemble really exercises a developer's communication skills. Just from a coding standpoint, I could no longer rely on my muscle memory when refactoring a component or test driving a feature. I had to explicitly explain what to do in order to control someone else’s muscles — the person typing on the keyboard. I had to explain it in a way that made sense to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;From a communication standpoint, it was important to explain why I decided what I did and how it added value. The best experience I had during the driver-navigator rotation was when the navigator, at the start of the rotation, would explain their thought process at a very high level and then went into the nitty-gritty details of what was needed to achieve the work. This gave everyone an understanding of what we were doing and allowed people to follow along more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I also found that it was important to overly communicate what was going on in my head. When I was a navigator and got stuck sometimes, people would chime in and provide help, which was great. However, if I didn’t acknowledge their suggestion explicitly and instead just kept talking to try to implement it, especially when I managed to do it incorrectly, people expressed behaviors reflecting that they felt ignored. Explicit acknowledgements such as “thanks for that suggestion, let me try a couple things to see what works” or “that's a great suggestion, what's the best way to implement that?” really hit home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Listening skills are also important. In an ensemble, I’m not listening to one other person. Often, I am listening to four other people, who may offer suggestions, ask questions, or even counter the direction I decide to go, at any given time. It is important to acknowledge what was said so that people feel heard and understood. Everyone’s voice matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/strong&gt;The performance and vibe of a team greatly improves with strong communication and listening skills.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ensemble programming is a software development approach where the whole team works together, builds on the principles of extreme programming, and works for distributed teams. Note that the basic fundamentals of any high-performing team is teamwork: a group of developers working together, supporting each other, and making progress toward a common goal. Ensemble programming accomplishes this through shared code ownership, knowledge sharing, and collaborative coding.&lt;/p&gt;

2. S3 origin
3. CloudFront
4. Terraform
5. 功能代码

**大纲：**

- 引言
- 实现使用S3 origin的方法
- 使用CloudFront进行改进并解决问题
- 实现CloudFront解决方案的步骤
- CloudFront解决方案的不足之处

**总结：**

这篇文章讨论了如何通过Web URL提供静态文件以传达环境信息给客户端。作者提到了使用S3 origin和Terraform来实现这一目标的方法。然后，作者介绍了如何通过使用CloudFront和功能代码来改进这个解决方案，并解决了资源使用的问题。最后，作者讨论了使用CloudFront解决方案的一些不足之处，如部署周期、函数代码限制和更改函数代码的问题。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-return-a-static-file-with-a-cloudfront-function/"&gt;(Read this article on the blog)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 id="environment-information"&gt;Environment information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I need to make a small static file available via a web URL. For example, to communicate pieces of information about the environment to clients, such
as the Cognito login URL they need to use, I make a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;/config.mjs&lt;/code&gt; or similar with that information. The client then knows where to find this information and can fetch it when it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="internal_link_box my-5 p-3 pt-3 position-relative"&gt;
          &lt;div class="box-title text-monospace position-absolute py-1 px-3"&gt;
            Related
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
              &lt;div class="row"&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-md-5 box-image mb-3"&gt;
                  &lt;a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-provide-information-about-the-backend-environment-to-frontend-clients/"&gt; 
                    
                    &lt;img class="w-100 h-100 img-bordered" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/53a1c4-5b85fa1c576acf6d90441683cf40b5f7ad3e1afe2c7b864efb05242a4de65be7.jpg" /&gt;
                  &lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-md-7"&gt;
                  &lt;div class="h4 box-element-title mt-0 mb-0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-provide-information-about-the-backend-environment-to-frontend-clients/"&gt;How to provide information about the backend environment to frontend clients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class="box-element-excerpt mt-2"&gt;
                    Environment variable-like functionality for client applications
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement this, I usually opt for an S3 origin with a single file deployed with Terraform, as described in the linked article. While this setup works well, I
started thinking whether I could solve the same problem with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudFront supports running arbitrary code for client requests and they can also return a static response without going to the origin. This makes a suitable
solution for this problem: since the function code is generated by Terraform it can include not just static data but also information about resources in the
stack. This makes this solution a valid alternative to communicate environment data to clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="implementation"&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down the different parts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, write the function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-terraform highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_cloudfront_function"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"static_file"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"static_file-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"cloudfront-js-1.0"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;
function handler(event) {
	return {
		statusCode: 200,
		statusDescription: "OK",
		body: {
			encoding: "base64",
			data: "${base64encode(trimspace(&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOT
This is a response defined in Terraform.
It can even include dynamic values: ${aws_lambda_function.tester.arn}
EOT
			))}"
		}
	}
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function returns a status code (200), a description (“OK”), and a body. The body then is encoded in Base64 to avoid any escaping issues and the data uses
Terraform’s &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;base64encode&lt;/code&gt; function with the HEREDOC syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value defined here is returned to the clients as-is and Terraform can insert data that is available during the deployment. In the above example, it includes
the ARN of a Lambda function, but it can equally be a Cognito Client ID, an invoke URL, or anything else the clients might need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no origin that CloudFront will contact, it is still a required element. To make sure there is an error in case it tries to contact it, the
special &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;.invalid&lt;/code&gt; domain can be used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-terraform highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;domain_name&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"invalid.invalid"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin_id&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"invalid"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;custom_origin_config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;http_port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https_port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;443&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin_protocol_policy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"http-only"&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin_ssl_protocols&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"TLSv1.2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache behavior then defines the path pattern for the file and configures the function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-terraform highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ordered_cache_behavior&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path_pattern&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/static_file"&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target_origin_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"invalid"&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class="nx"&gt;function_association&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event_type&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"viewer-request"&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="nx"&gt;function_arn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_cloudfront_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;static_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arn&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending a request to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;/static_file&lt;/code&gt; then returns the contents defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="disadvantages"&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a more optimized solution compared to the S3 file-based one there are a few drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it is easier to end up with a deployment cycle as the CloudFront distribution depends on the function. For example, if a Cognito Client ID is included in
the returned data while the Cognito Client defines the CloudFront domain as an allowed callback URL then Terraform can’t deploy the stack. To deploy the
function, it needs the Client ID. But to create the Cognito Client, it needs the CloudFront distribution. But the distribution needs the function before it can
be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a problem with the S3-based solution as the file can be added last when all the other resources are already created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, it works only for small file. CloudFront functions &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-functions"&gt;have a
limit&lt;/a&gt; of 10KB of function code, so anything that it
returns must fit in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, changing the function code is problematic. Terraform tries to destroy the old one first before creating the new one. This looks like a problem with
the Terraform provider, so probably it will be fixed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NWRUG's October 2023 Meeting (19 October)</title>
      <link>https://thoughtbot.com/blog/nwrug-s-october-2023-meeting-19-october</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It will soon be NWRUG&amp;rsquo;s October 2023 meet-up on Thursday, 19 October, at
IntelliCentrics UK&amp;rsquo;s offices. To attend, please secure a spot on &lt;a href="https://www.tickettailor.com/events/nwrug/1028423"&gt;their Ticket
Tailor page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, thoughtbot&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://ruby.social/@slickepinne"&gt;Svenja Schäfer&lt;/a&gt; will be giving a remote talk called
&amp;ldquo;How regular expressions made my dog less reactive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it: Regular Expressions are intimidating. As soon as we know we
have to deal with them, we open StackOverflow. Someone has the answer. We
might not know if it’s correct, but at least we can write some tests around
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I tell you, that my dog, Hugo, with serious fear for everything
unknown, moving or not moving, big or small, became less reactive – with the
help of regular expressions? This talk will give you the answer and a
guideline to understand regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Run Cypress Specs In Parallel For Free Using Spec Timings</title>
      <link>https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-parallel-free-based-on-timings/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Cypress-the-company blocked projects that use 3rd party dashboard plugins like &lt;code&gt;sorry-cypress&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cypress blocked 3rd party dashboard plugins" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/blocked.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details see &lt;a href="https://currents.dev/posts/v13-blocking"&gt;Cypress.io Blocking of Sorry Cypress and Currents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="free-solution-is-available"&gt;Free solution is available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to split your multiple specs across multiple machines for free, I have created &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split"&gt;cypress-split&lt;/a&gt; plugin and described how to &lt;a href="https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-parallel-free/" title="Run Cypress Specs In Parallel For Free"&gt;Run Cypress Specs In Parallel For Free&lt;/a&gt;. This solution does not &amp;quot;mimic&amp;quot; the Cypress Cloud API, thus it should not be banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;☢️ If Cypress team DOES block &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split"&gt;cypress-split&lt;/a&gt; plugin, then I will have no choice but to block all my Cypress plugins (I have written 75+ Cypress plugins) if Cypress is run with &lt;code&gt;--record&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All we need to do to use this plugin is to add it to the &lt;code&gt;setupNodeEvents&lt;/code&gt; callback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight js"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;cypress.config.mjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#123; defineConfig &amp;#125; &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#x27;cypress&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; cypressSplit &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#x27;cypress-split&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="variable language_"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="property"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="title function_"&gt;defineConfig&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;e2e&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// baseUrl, etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;supportFile&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="literal"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;fixturesFolder&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="literal"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="title function_"&gt;setupNodeEvents&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="params"&gt;on, config&lt;/span&gt;) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;      &lt;span class="title function_"&gt;cypressSplit&lt;/span&gt;(on, config)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;      &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// IMPORTANT: return the config object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;      &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &amp;#125;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &amp;#125;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&amp;#125;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specs were split purely based on their names in the list, which can create unbalanced lists for machines. For example, let's take a project with five specs split across two machines. The first run splits the specs alphabetically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alphabetical spec timings on two machines" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/t1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is our GitHub Actions workflow file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/ci.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;

In this examples I am using version v1 the &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ughh, there is a spec &lt;code&gt;spec-d.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; that is much longer than others, and it makes the second machine take much longer. While the second machine is running &lt;code&gt;spec-d.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;spec-e.cy.js&lt;/code&gt;, the first machine is idle. It would be better to shift the spec &lt;code&gt;spec-e.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; to the first machine. Then we would save 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="timings"&gt;Timings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's tell &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; to split specs based on previous run timings. Unfortunately, we do not have 3rd party service to keep track of spec timings, thus we need to do it ourselves. Let's set another environment variable &lt;code&gt;SPLIT_FILE&lt;/code&gt; on the test runners. Right now, it points at a non-existent file &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; in the root folder of the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/ci.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="string"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="bullet"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;Cypress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;tests&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;🧪&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;# https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;uses:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;cypress-io/github-action@v6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;with:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;# we don&amp;#x27;t need Cypress own runner summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;publish-summary:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="literal"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;env:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;SPLIT:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;$&amp;#123;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;strategy.job-total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;SPLIT_INDEX:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;$&amp;#123;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;strategy.job-index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;SPLIT_FILE:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#x27;timings.json&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's run the workflow again. The &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; file is not found yet, no big deal.

splits the specs based on durations. The first machine runs only the spec &lt;code&gt;cypress/e2e/spec-d.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; which takes by itself 60 seconds. The second machine runs the rest of the specs that together take up 40 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Specs split based on timings" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/t4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice. The spec split implementation can be found in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split/blob/main/src/timings.js"&gt;src&amp;#x2f;timings.js&lt;/a&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; plugin. Right now it is a simple greedy algorithm, but it seems to work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="updating-timingsjson-file-single-ci-job"&gt;Updating timings.json file: single CI job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If specs change or new specs are added, the timings file becomes out-of-date. I have a couple of ideas how to update it periodically without relying on 3rd party service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; if the spec is new and does not have duration in the timings file yet, the split algorithm assigns it an average duration of all existing specs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first strategy is to use a single long CI job that runs all specs and then commits the updated &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; file. It is very easy to commit changed files when using GitHub Actions CI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/nightly.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;

If there are any changes to the timings, the &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; file is committed and pushed to the repository using the wonderful reusable GitHub Action &lt;a href="https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action"&gt;stefanzweifel&amp;#x2f;git-auto-commit-action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; writes new timings file only if there are new specs or any durations are off by more than 10% from the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="updating-timingsjson-file-merge-timings"&gt;Updating timings.json file: merge timings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of running a single job with all specs to update the timings file, we can use my &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; workflow from &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows"&gt;cypress-workflows&lt;/a&gt; repo. It works with &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; alias &lt;code&gt;cypress-split-merge&lt;/code&gt; to merge downloaded timings files from parallel runs and output a single combined JSON as a GitHub Actions output. Here is an example workflow from &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split-timings-example"&gt;cypress-split-timings-example&lt;/a&gt; repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/split.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;

**总结：**
文章讨论了API商业化的潜力和怎样实现API的商业化。作者强调了选择合适的商业化模式和构建适当的技术栈的重要性。对于商业化模式的选择，作者建议提供多种模式，并根据API的功能和特点确定最佳模式。文章还提到了构建API商业化技术栈所需考虑的操作流程和最佳实践。最后，作者希望读者能从他的演讲中获得关于API商业化的基础知识和技术考虑，以帮助他们有效实现API的商业化。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#8217;ve previously covered, APIs have much &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/planning-for-success-with-an-api-as-a-product-approach/"&gt;productization potential&lt;/a&gt;. But how exactly should these services be &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/self-service-is-key-for-api-monetization/"&gt;monetized&lt;/a&gt;? There is an emerging art around knowing how to charge for API calls and how to construct a viable, scalable operational process to support the API business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_16975" style="width: 190px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Matt-Tanner-Moesif" class=" wp-image-16975" height="180" src="https://nordicapis.com/wp-content/uploads/Matt-Tanner-Moesif.jpeg" width="180" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-16975"&gt;At Platform Summit 2023, Matt Tanner will dive deep into strategies for building your API monetization stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/speakers/matt-tanner/"&gt;Matt Tanner&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Developer Relations at Moesif, many companies are seeking to drive more revenue amid a slimmer economy and are turning to APIs as a new avenue for growth. Monetizing valuable proprietary services and data, for instance, is an exciting frontier, but it requires the &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/10-helpful-api-monetization-tools/"&gt;right technology stack&lt;/a&gt; to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/events/platform-summit-2023/"&gt;Platform Summit 2023&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;re chatting with key speakers to learn what they&amp;#8217;re working on and to get more background on their upcoming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt has worked as a developer, tech lead, and architect for some of Canada&amp;#8217;s largest financial institutions and insurers. At Moesif, he&amp;#8217;s been helping developers and product managers understand and use API analytics and new monetization tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up with Matt to dig into API monetization, the theme of his upcoming deep dive on &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/sessions/deep-dive-building-an-api-monetization-stack/"&gt;building an API monetization stack&lt;/a&gt; — a presentation built on two years of working heavily within the API monetization space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for the interview with Matt below, and be sure to attend the &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/events/platform-summit-2023/"&gt;Platform Summit 2023&lt;/a&gt; for more discussion on this topic and plenty of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is API monetization trending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many businesses are now realizing that APIs have a default ability to create a new stream of revenue. Especially with the current state of the economy here in the US and Canada, organizations are looking for any place possible to drive revenue. Certain technologies have also recently emerged which allow API monetization to be implemented more easily. This means that businesses considering it on their 3-5-year roadmap can now implement it much more quickly. This is a key driver I&amp;#8217;ve seen as well that has led to this uptick in API monetization popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What types of APIs can or should be monetized?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two factors to consider: does the API deliver a valuable service, and are people willing to pay for that? A good example I like to use is for a credit score API. Let&amp;#8217;s say I&amp;#8217;m a fintech company, and I have built an API that can query multiple credit bureaus and aggregate an overall credit score. This API&amp;#8217;s value proposition is that it can retrieve a credit score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question is, &amp;#8220;Do other businesses also need this?&amp;#8221;. In this case, the answer is absolutely! So, this would be a good example of an easily monetizable API (a term I have apparently just made up). Most companies have a really good idea of their most valuable proprietary APIs — they just need to ask who else may be willing to pay to use that service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should prospective API providers consider when choosing their monetization model? (Transaction volume, reve share, data volume, user-centric, resource, etc.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think offering multiple models is the best, or at least having the capability to do so. It really depends on the overall business model. For instance, it makes sense to monetize a payment processing API based on a revenue share/percentage model, such as charging 2% per transaction. In this case, it would likely not make sense to charge per API call or per user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, understanding what the API does and the most efficient way to charge for it helps uncover which model is best. Often, the limitation on monetization comes from the technology side. An example would be if you wanted to charge based on resource usage, but your metering solution only counts per API call. Then, you&amp;#8217;ll be limited to that one model. Finding the right tech will be the biggest hurdle to actually supporting different monetization models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What goes into constructing an API monetization stack? What are the operational processes to consider?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime you build something, you always want to look at what your landscape already includes. Understand the capabilities of your API gateway (if using one), what limitations a billing provider may have, etc. Once you know what you have, you can figure out what you can build with it. That will help you establish the parameters of what&amp;#8217;s possible. In an ideal world, though, you&amp;#8217;d first come up with your exact business cases, find the tech to facilitate that functionality, and then implement it from a clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, as we know, that doesn&amp;#8217;t tend to happen. Establish what you need a system to do that will monetize your APIs, then figure out the limitations (ones you can change and those that are immovable), and then implement. It sounds pretty straightforward, but you&amp;#8217;d be surprised how many people get 90% of the way there and then realize they #1 can&amp;#8217;t use the tech they require or #2 don&amp;#8217;t realize the limitations of the tech they&amp;#8217;ve chosen to build with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any anti-patterns you&amp;#8217;ve witnessed when it comes to monetizing APIs in practice? How about best practices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I&amp;#8217;ve seen is that people tend to think of monetization in two ways. The first would be to use a subscription model, and the second is to just use a &amp;#8220;charge per API call approach&amp;#8221;. These are two ways to monetize APIs. However, they don&amp;#8217;t necessarily mean you&amp;#8217;re delivering value to a customer. And most importantly, it also may mean that you are leaving potential revenue on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with defaulting to a subscription-based model is that aligning value is hard. If I charge $5k per month for API access, regardless of how many API calls or resources are used, then those making the most use of the service will likely be getting the highest while those making the least use will see a major value discrepancy. Tiers can help to offset this disparity but still leave a value gap most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A way around this is to charge based on usage, particularly per API call. With usage-based pricing, you can get closer to equal value by charging for exact use. The issue is that not every API call is equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to our payment processing API example, if I process a $2 payment through the API vs a $2000 payment, but I&amp;#8217;m paying the same amount per API call/transaction, the API call for the lower amount may have a value issue that pops up. If the price per API call was $1, then they are looking at a 50% fee versus a $1 charge against the $2000 payment, where the fee is substantially lower compared to the amount of money transacted. In this case, you&amp;#8217;d want to pick the model that is fair to customers and drives the most revenue internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For best practices, putting my software architect hat on, I suggest questioning every single scenario and mapping out edge cases. Most platforms that help with monetization can do the simple stuff well, but the edge cases become infinitely more complex to handle correctly. Since every API monetization initiative will be pretty custom, good planning is the key to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you looking forward to the Platform Summit 2023?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very excited to see the different opinions and folks within the API community. I&amp;#8217;m also excited on a personal level to visit Sweden for the first time. I think the collective knowledge that will be at this conference will give me some great insights, and I&amp;#8217;m also excited to share my knowledge with others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope attendees will take away from your talk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope attendees will see that API monetization is hard but worth it. Many companies I talk to struggle to figure out where to start. This talk will give them a solid foundation of the business fundamentals and all of the technical considerations. Hopefully, our learnings at Moesif over the last two years will benefit others as they strive to monetize their APIs effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CodeSOD: Taking the Temperature</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/taking-the-temperature</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. TA&lt;/strong&gt; inherited some C# code that communicates with a humidity and a temperature sensor. Each sensor logs a series of datapoints as they run, and can provide them as an array of data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;DataPoint[] humidDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-literal"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;;  
DataPoint[] tempDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-literal"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// For now,  determine if this is the primary or secondary sensor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (sensorType == (&lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;)SensorTypeID.HUMIDITY)
{
    &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// create the array size then get the data&lt;/span&gt;
    humidDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataPoint[ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().Count];
    humidDataPointArray = ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().ToArray();
}
&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
{
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (sensorNum == &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
    {
        &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// create the array size then get the data&lt;/span&gt;
        tempDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataPoint[((SingleSensorTemptale)ttData).PrimarySensorData.GetDataPoints().Count];
        tempDataPointArray = ((SingleSensorTemptale)ttData).PrimarySensorData.GetDataPoints().ToArray();
    }
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    {
        &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// create the array size then get the data&lt;/span&gt;
        tempDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataPoint[ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().Count];
        tempDataPointArray = ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().ToArray();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts out okay. We create the arrays to hold the data. Then we check the &lt;code&gt;sensorType&lt;/code&gt; against an enum. And that's where things start to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initialize an empty array that's the same size as the number of data points, then we set that array equal to the array of data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm stuck trying to figure out if this is someone with no real experience, or a C programmer trying to migrate from pointers to references. Since C# is uses references, we don't need that &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;- we can just set &lt;code&gt;humidPointsArray&lt;/code&gt; equal to the result of the function call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the result of the function call- it looks like &lt;code&gt;GetDataPoints()&lt;/code&gt; returns a C# enumerable type. Which implies there's really no good reason to convert it into an array. I can't be certain about that, maybe they really need the array, but I suspect that's not the case- and it's a best practice in C# to use more abstract interfaces for collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; inside of it, instead of an &lt;code&gt;else if&lt;/code&gt;. This second condition eschews the lovely enum we used before, and just checks &lt;code&gt;sensorNum == 1&lt;/code&gt;. Then we repeat the same unnecessary allocation, with the bonus misspelling of &lt;code&gt;SingleSensorTemptale&lt;/code&gt;, which is certain never to give any future developer problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a bonus, this code runs in a tight loop, ensuring the garbage collector gets lots of practice cleaning up memory we never needed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: Honestly, it's the switch from enum to not enum that bothers me the most --&gt;

      <title>CDKTF 0.19 adds support for config-driven import and refactoring</title>
      <link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cdktf-0-19-adds-support-for-config-driven-import-and-refactoring</link>
      <description>**关键词：**
- CDK for Terraform (CDKTF)
- config-driven import
- refactoring
- resource migration
- Terraform

**大纲：**
1. CDKTF (CDK for Terraform)简介和目标
2. CDKTF的新功能：支持config-driven import和refactoring
    - 介绍CDKTF v0.19版本的发布
    - config-driven import的两种工作流程
    - refactoring中的resource移动支持
3. 如何尝试CDK for Terraform

**总结：**
CDK for Terraform (CDKTF)旨在简化Terraform的使用，通过支持多种编程语言的配置编写和引入新的功能来实现这一目标。最新版本的CDKTF (CDKTF v0.19)改进了支持config-driven import和refactoring的能力，使得开发人员可以安全地将现有基础架构引入CDKTF项目中，并进行重构操作。通过使用CDKTF，开发人员可以更方便地迁移和管理资源，而不会影响业务连续性。如果想尝试CDK for Terraform，可以查看CDKTF的教程，深入了解CDKTF的文档，并通过讨论论坛与其他用户交流。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mission of CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) is to simplify Terraform adoption. We introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cdk-for-terraform-now-generally-available"&gt;generally available version of CDKTF&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2022,  enabling developers not familiar with HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to write Terraform configurations in their choice of language, including TypeScript, Python, C#, Java, and Go. In July of 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/new-multi-language-docs-simplify-cdk-for-terraform-adoption"&gt;multi-language provider documentation for CDKTF&lt;/a&gt; further simplified infrastructure provisioning by offering provider configuration options and code samples for the programming languages supported by CDKTF, alongside the HCL documentation in the registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working to make CDKTF more powerful by supporting new Terraform features to achieve cost savings and improve security. Up until now, CDKTF had limited support for import and moved blocks, resulting in manual, cumbersome resource migration and refactoring within a CDKTF project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re releasing CDKTF version 0.19, which improves support for &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-5-brings-config-driven-import-and-checks"&gt;config-driven import&lt;/a&gt; and refactoring. This support allows developers to safely move resources and bring existing infrastructure into CDKTF projects with auto-generated code — without jeopardizing business continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Config-driven import support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importing existing infrastructure into a CDKTF project was a manual process until &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-5-brings-config-driven-import-and-checks"&gt;Terraform 1.5 introduced config-driven import&lt;/a&gt; in June. CDKTF v0.19 adds &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf/concepts/resources#importing-resources"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; for config-driven import (which requires Terraform 1.5+) with two workflows, described below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Specify a CDKTF config for a resource and specify where it is currently living:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instantiate an instance of the resource type you want to import, with an empty configuration. Then call the &lt;code&gt;importFrom&lt;/code&gt; method on the resource object, providing the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; present for the resource in the cloud provider:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new S3Bucket(this, "bucket", {}).importFrom("id-in-cloud-provider")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;When running a &lt;code&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;, you will get a message saying that your resource is going to be imported. Once you run &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;, you can remove the &lt;code&gt;importFrom&lt;/code&gt; call and the resource will now be managed by CDKTF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Generate configuration for an existing resource&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to generate configuration for an imported resource, you can use the static method &lt;code&gt;generateConfigForImport&lt;/code&gt; by specifying the type of a resource and its resource ID. When you run a plan, Terraform will generate HCL config for the resource and CDKTF will convert it to your language of choice: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;S3Bucket.generateConfigForImport(this, "bucket", "id-in-cloud-provider");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Resource refactoring with moved block support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ID of a resource is changed — for example, by refactoring it into a nested construct — destroying and recreating the resource is the default behavior of Terraform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the new &lt;code&gt;moveTo&lt;/code&gt; method lets you refactor code without losing the state or destroying and recreating the resources being moved. This is especially important when working in a production environment where you might want to restructure your code but can't afford service downtime or data loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;moveTo&lt;/code&gt; function is available on all resources and is used for relocating a resource to the location specified by the string target. To set the string target for a resource, use the &lt;code&gt;addMoveTarget&lt;/code&gt; function present on the resource to move to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new S3Bucket(this, "test-bucket-move-to", {
	bucket: "move-bucket-name",
}).addMoveTarget("move-s3");

new S3Bucket(this, "test-bucket-move-from", {
	bucket: "move-bucket-name",
}).moveTo("move-s3");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try CDK for Terraform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to the project, these &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf"&gt;tutorials for CDKTF&lt;/a&gt; are the best way to get started. You can dive deeper into our documentation with this &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf"&gt;overview of CDKTF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

- 文档团队的工作过程和贡献
- 在WordCamps中的参与和贡献
- 对WordPress社区的思考和感悟

**总结：**
本文讲述了Leonardus Nugraha（Leo）是Hostinger公司WordPress类别的内容专家，他通过个人经历介绍了他是如何进入WordPress世界并成为其中文档团队的一员的。Leo对WordPress的热爱使得他不仅仅写作关于WordPress的文章，还亲自深入参与了文档团队的工作，贡献自己的力量。作为文档团队成员，Leo通过学习文档团队的GitHub问题和参与团队会议的方式，为WordPress的终端用户和开发者撰写了包括技术指南、支持指南和自定义等多个方面的文档。此外，Leo还积极参与了WordCamps活动，不仅以志愿者的身份参与其中，还担任摄影师记录活动的精彩瞬间。通过在WordPress社区中的互动和贡献，Leo体验到了全球WordPress社区的热情和活力。在他的眼中，WP社区不仅仅是一个技术平台，更是一个充满人文关怀和激情的大家庭。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/leonnugraha/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Leonardus Nugraha&lt;/a&gt;, or Leo for short, is &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/" rel="follow"&gt;Hostinger&lt;/a&gt;’s own Content Specialist for the WordPress category. Hailing from Bogor, Indonesia, which is known for its lush botanical garden, Leo is drawn to photographing his rich surroundings. But there’s also another thing he enjoys documenting – the advancements of &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-wordpress" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn how Leo entered the world of WordPress and became part of its documentation team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-into-the-business"&gt;Getting Into the Business&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo first dipped his toes into WordPress at university, where he studied business management. During the IT in Business course, he had to create an eCommerce website from scratch. Among the various &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-a-cms/" rel="follow"&gt;content management systems&lt;/a&gt; available, Leo opted for WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That was the first time I learned about website building. We found out how to get a domain and hosting, install WordPress and &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/woocommerce-tutorial" rel="follow"&gt;WooCommerce&lt;/a&gt;, add products, and integrate payment gateways. The experience introduced me to a wider WordPress ecosystem besides the WordPress.com I had known,&amp;#8221; Leo reminisces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though he drifted away from WordPress after the project, this experience came in handy when Leo joined Hostinger as a content writer in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides crafting articles about WordPress, his team uses the CMS for publishing. &amp;#8220;I had to familiarize myself with the nuances of WordPress once more, from content publishing to understanding &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/video/what-is-seo" rel="follow"&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt; intricacies,&amp;#8221; Leo adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2021, his role had evolved, focusing more on WordPress content. This propelled him to dive deeper into the platform&amp;#8217;s technicalities. “I started to learn more about WordPress customization, keeping up with new versions, and following its development,&amp;#8221; he shares.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo&amp;#8217;s educational background, which includes a Master&amp;#8217;s degree in International Business from Monash University Malaysia, also equipped him with key skills in digital marketing for his involvement in a global open-source project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In my major, there was a strong emphasis on collaboration and project management,” he says. &amp;#8220;Collaborating with diverse groups and understanding different cultures during my studies has prepared me for my journey as a content marketer and a WordPress contributor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diving-into-wordpress-documentation"&gt;Diving Into WordPress Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to create good content about a platform, you should use it. While it is true, it wasn’t enough for Leo – he went the extra mile by diving deep into the heart of WordPress and contributing to its &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Documentation team&lt;/a&gt;. His transition from a user to a contributor reflects not only his commitment, but also the open and welcoming nature of the &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wordpress" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spark for this journey was lit shortly after Leo began writing extensively about WordPress. As an open-source platform, WordPress heavily relies on its community of contributors. When the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Five for the Future&lt;/a&gt; initiative surfaced, Hostinger decided to &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/hostinger-international/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;take part in it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My manager asked me if I wanted to participate in this initiative. I was eager to contribute, and since I’m a WordPress content specialist, I naturally gravitated towards the Documentation team,&amp;#8221; Leo says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I began learning about the Documentation team from &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the Contributor Handbook&lt;/a&gt;,” Leo recalls. “It’s pretty challenging at first. But then my manager introduced me to &lt;a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/milana_cap/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Milana Cap&lt;/a&gt;, the Documentation team representative, and she guided me through it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo then took a GitHub issue to learn how to create proper documentation for the first time. It was a new document request, which he found to be enjoyable. “I loved crafting new documents. It’s somehow more exciting than doing updates,” he laughs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leonardus Nugraha and his WordPress Documentation teammates in Community Summit 2023" class="wp-image-5629" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/leo-and-documentation-team-in-community-summit-2023-1024x683.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becoming more engaged in Documentation contribution, Leo started attending the team’s weekly meetings. He’s been volunteering to facilitate the assembly from time to time. He keeps expanding his participation by constantly learning new tasks in the team, such as helping to onboard new contributors in the Documentation table during the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/contributor-day/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Contributor Day&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp US 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s fun to be at the Documentation team’s table during Contributor Day. Besides being able to work in-person with people I normally only interact with on GitHub and Slack, there are lots of cookies to try,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cookies he mentions are the Docs team’s tradition during Contributor Days – Milana brings various cookies to munch together during the event. “In the Docs team’s Slack channel, we usually give kudos – a way to say someone is doing a good job – by giving a cookie emoji. So we bring it to life during Contributor Day at our table. Of course, we share them with other teams as well,” Leo remarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And to answer a common query, Leo clarifies that one doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be a technical expert to contribute to the team. “There are two types of documentation: end-user and developer. For end-user documentation, if you use WordPress and understand its workings, you should be able to write the docs. It&amp;#8217;s basically about guiding other users to navigate inside the platform. However, creating developer documentation needs technical knowledge to a certain extent.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rolling-as-a-documentation-team-member"&gt;Rolling as a Documentation Team Member&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work of WordPress&amp;#8217;s Documentation team involves more processes than solely writing the guidance. “The Docs team aims to ensure that each feature is accurately and comprehensively explained. For example, let’s take &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wordpress-blocks" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress Blocks&lt;/a&gt;. When creating documentation about the feature, we explain what it is and detail how to use its and its features. If any visual representations are available, we will include them in the documentation, so that end-users can understand it better,” Leo explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the process to craft a documentation article that Leo usually goes through:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scour the &lt;a href="https://github.com/WordPress/documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Documentation Team GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for issues you want to work on, then assign yourself to the issue.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Start drafting. You can do it in Google Docs, or directly on the WordPress back end if you have access.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When writing, you can test the feature, but make sure to refer to the GitHub ticket that explains what the feature is.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Once the draft is ready, reviewers will step in to ensure the content aligns with style guides and formatting requirements. They will also make edits if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When it gets reviewed, the documentation can be published.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo also mentions that the Docs team regularly updates the existing documentation. “In every WordPress release, the Documentation release squad will check the existing documentation and see what updates must be made. This applies for both end-user and developer documentation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then explains that these updates usually are made during the &lt;a href="https://theproductmanager.com/topics/software-release-life-cycle/#:~:text=A%20release%20candidate%20(RC)%20is,to%20as%20%E2%80%9CControlled%20Availability%E2%80%9D." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Release Candidate&lt;/a&gt; period. There can also be updates outside the release cycle, if minor changes are applied or any errors found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for now, there are four main categories for end-user documentation on the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordPress Documentation&lt;/a&gt; website – WordPress overview, technical guides, support guides, and customization. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;developer documentation&lt;/a&gt; is categorized based on more specific topics such as code reference, plugins, and the block editor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="the homepage of WordPress Documentation website that shows user documentation" class="wp-image-5630" height="414" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/wordpress-documentation-1024x414.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that developer documentation is different from &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/writing-developer-notes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;developer notes&lt;/a&gt;. Developer documentation covers broader technical aspects of WordPress, such as the best coding practices and how to interact with various APIs. Meanwhile, a developer note contains the details of technical changes in an upcoming WordPress release, and what developers need to know about such changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Leo has never touched on developer documentation, he did work on the developer notes for &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wordpress-6-3-release-leads" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress 6.3&lt;/a&gt;. “I gathered notes about new features, code changes, and its utilization. Then I categorized them, and published them during the release cycle,&amp;#8221; he elaborates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To bring structure and direction, there’s a biweekly meeting within the Docs team. The session involves team updates, work progress, and brainstorming, while the triage meeting focuses on assigning GitHub issues to contributors. “So if there&amp;#8217;s a high priority documentation, or if there are backlogs, we just post in the triage meeting and ask who wants to work on it,” Leo explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then mentions that the Docs team also carries out an online Contributor Day every fourth week of the month. The event comes in the form of a three-hour Zoom session. Leo adds, “It’s an easy entry point for newcomers, and often includes onboarding calls in a separate break room.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-lines-behind-the-lens"&gt;Beyond the Lines, Behind the Lens&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like many WordPress enthusiasts, Leo always looks forward to attending &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/what-is-wordcamp" rel="follow"&gt;WordCamps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My first WordCamp was &lt;a href="https://gresik.wordcamp.org/2022/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp Gresik 2022&lt;/a&gt;, a local WordCamp in Indonesia. There were around 200 attendees, just one conference day and one contributor&amp;#8217;s day. It gave me the idea of what WordCamp is,” Leo recalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At WordCamp Gresik, besides attending presentations, he joined the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Polyglots Team&lt;/a&gt;’s table. “There was no Documentation table, so I thought it would be great to explore other teams,” Leo adds. He unexpectedly became a &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/about/roles-and-capabilities/#general-translation-editor" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;General Translation Editor&lt;/a&gt; there, broadening his contribution horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the things Leo loves the most about WordCamps is the opportunity to network with other WordPress enthusiasts and professionals. As a part of the Hostinger team, he also gets to interact with our &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/wordpress-hosting" rel="follow"&gt;Managed WordPress hosting&lt;/a&gt; customers. &amp;#8220;Engaging with fellow WordPress users and industry people expanded my understanding of the global WordPress community,&amp;#8221; he expresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo also enjoys volunteering for WordCamps, especially as a photographer. &amp;#8220;My first experience volunteering for WordCamp was in &lt;a href="https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp Asia 2023&lt;/a&gt;, where I volunteered as a photographer. I&amp;#8217;ve always had a &lt;a href="https://leoandlens.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;passion for photography&lt;/a&gt;, so this let me merge my hobby and contribution while enjoying the event,&amp;#8221; Leo states.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leonardus Nugraha and Indonesian WordPress community in WordCamp Asia 2023" class="wp-image-5631" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/leo-and-indonesian-wordpress-community-1024x683.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While his strong side is landscape and architecture photography, Leo is fond of capturing candid moments at WordCamps. &amp;#8220;I adore candid shots, people in spontaneous interactions. They capture the WordCamp spirit authentically,&amp;#8221; he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although not an active member of the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/photos/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Photos Team&lt;/a&gt;, Leo has made his mark by uploading some of his photo works to the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/photos/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Photo Directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on WordCamp memories, his thoughts always return to WordCamp Asia&amp;#8217;s first day. &amp;#8220;It was surreal, meeting and connecting with the global WordPress community face-to-face. These interactions, dinners, and after-parties have carved unforgettable memories,&amp;#8221; Leo concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In essence, Leo&amp;#8217;s journey in the WordPress community is not just about contributions. It&amp;#8217;s about connections, passion, and memorable moments that span across continents and pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stay Motivated When Working on a Difficult Story</title>
      <link>https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/10/17/motivated-difficult-story/</link>
      <description>**关键词**: 问题解决, 进展追踪, 工作切换, 伙伴合作, 激励方法

**大纲**:
- 追踪进展：记录工作的进展情况，避免感觉停滞不前
- 工作切换：在不同任务之间切换，避免对单一任务过度投入
- 休息放松：暂时放下长期困扰的任务，休息一天后重新开始可能有新的想法
- 伙伴合作：与其他开发人员一起工作，获得新的观点和避免枯燥感
- 寻找激励方法：通过以上方法使自己保持积极状态

**总结**:
当我们在解决一个看似轻而易举的问题时，常常会遇到困境。需求不断变化，问题复杂度超出预期，这些原因都可能让我们感到沮丧。为了保持动力，有几个方法可以尝试。首先，追踪进展，记录工作的进展情况，避免感觉停滞不前。其次，可以在不同任务之间切换，避免对单一任务过度投入，从而获得一些小的成功，恢复工作的积极性。另外，对于没有时间限制的任务，可以暂时搁置一天，然后再回来，也许会有一些新的思路。此外，可以邀请其他开发人员合作，获得新的观点和避免枯燥感。最后，寻找适合自己的激励方法，通过以上方法保持积极状态。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;It happens to all of us. We start working on a story that seems like it should be a breeze, but we quickly get a dose of reality. Maybe some requirements keep changing. Maybe there&amp;#8217;s more heavy factoring than expected. Whatever the reason, it can feel demoralizing to work on a problem that might feel ever-growing. Here are some tips to stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep track of your progress.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most demotivating parts of working on a problem that drags on is feeling like you’re not moving forward. It can feel sometimes as though success with software is defined by the number of &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/12/16/writing-good-stories/"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; completed. When one story goes on forever, it can feel like you’re not accomplishing enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the time every few hours to write a brief note about what you’ve done. Reminding yourself that you have done measurable work can help you feel less stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Switch chunks of work.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve spent a lot of time working on one chunk of the story and you’re starting to struggle (or maybe you&amp;#8217;re just getting bored). It’s okay to put your fears about &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/03/24/reduce-context-switching/"&gt;context switching&lt;/a&gt; aside and jump over to another chunk. There’s no use spinning your wheels on one subtask when you could knock out some other bits. A few small successes will also get you back into a productive mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the story you’re working on isn’t time-sensitive, it can sometimes help to take a break from it. Put the entire story on the back burner for a day. When you come back to it, you may have some fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pair frequently.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending a long time on a single piece of work can cause feelings of siloing. It can be useful to bring in other developers to work with you on a chunk of work. This has practical benefits, like new perspectives. Maybe more importantly in this situation, it helps with &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/04/11/strategies-stay-motiviated-when-bored/"&gt;boredom&lt;/a&gt;. Pairing frequently will keep you focused and moving toward finishing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Key Takeaways from #Current2023</title>
      <link>https://blog.cloudera.com/5-key-takeaways-from-current2023/</link>
      <description>**关键词**: Current 2023, Apache Flink, streaming database, Change Data Capture (CDC), tooling for Kafka ecosystem

**大纲**:

文章主要讨论了最近由Confluent举办的Current 2023（即Kafka峰会）的重要性以及会议中关键的五个观点。首先，Apache Flink被广泛认可为流处理的事实标准，其受欢迎程度逐渐接近Spark。其次，出现了一种新兴的竞争对手类型——“流数据库”，他们声称比Flink更快，并且具有更好的工具性能。接下来，Change Data Capture（CDC）的重要性逐渐凸显，Debezium成为CDC的事实标准。此外，关于Kafka生态系统的工具和工具性能有所改善，提供了更多的功能和改进的用户体验。最后，流处理技术仍有进一步发展和成熟的空间，尤其是在数据流的成熟度和实时处理方面。

**总结**: 

本文总结了Current 2023会议的关键观点，其中包括Apache Flink成为流处理的标准，出现了“流数据库”作为对Flink的替代品的新竞争对手，CDC的重要性以及Debezium在该领域的地位，工具性能的改善以及流处理技术的发展和成熟度方面的潜力。然而，尽管流处理技术的采用率不断增长，但其成熟度仍然处于早期阶段。综合而言，流处理仍有很大的发展空间，并且需要完整的工具支持。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1256169936-1-273x182.jpg" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Recently, Confluent hosted Current 2023 (formerly Kafka summit) in San Jose on Sept 26th and 27th. With few conferences curating content specific to streaming developers, Current has historically been an important event for anyone trying to keep a pulse on what’s happening in the streaming space.  Over 2,000 attendees and lots of new solutions were on display, and the event proved to be a clear look into the current (no pun intended) state of streaming and where it is headed. This blog is for anyone who was interested but unable to attend the conference, or anyone interested in a quick summary of what happened there. I will cover key takeaways from Current 2023 and offer Cloudera’s perspective. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Five Takeaways from Current 2023:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 1- The people have spoken and Apache Flink is the de facto standard for stream processing  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This may seem obvious to many who are already familiar with Flink, but it is worth pointing out. Architecture decisions have long-term effects and an important consideration when choosing a stream processing engine is whether the technology will stagnate or continue to evolve with contributions from the open source community. Will I be able to find developers for this three years from now? The answer from the community is a resounding yes. Flink is here to stay. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It makes perfect sense that Apache Flink has emerged as the standard. Flink was launched in 2015 as the world’s first open source streaming-first distributed stream processing engine and has since grown to rival Spark in terms of popularity. And the layered APIs from low-level operations to high-level abstractions gives Flink appeal to a broad range of users. The adoption of Flink mirrors growth in streaming data volumes and maturity of the streaming market. As organizations shift from the modernization of data-driven applications via Kafka towards delivering real-time &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;insight &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and/or powering smart automated systems, Flink &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At Current, adoption of Flink was a hot topic and many of the vendors (Cloudera included) use Flink as the engine to power their stream processing offerings as well.  Use cases such as fraud monitoring, real-time supply chain insight, IoT-enabled fleet operations, real-time customer intent, and modernizing analytics pipelines are driving development activity. The value of consolidating different processing frameworks onto a single comprehensive framework to minimize technical overhead and maintain innovation speed is well understood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The big announcement everyone was waiting for was the unveiling of Apache Flink in Confluent Cloud. The actual unveiling was a bit underwhelming as the SQL console left a lot to be desired, and outside of serverless auto-scaling functionality there was no “wow” factor. As of this writing, the product is still not GA and will not be made available on-prem, but the unveiling is still important due to the sheer size of the Confluent user base. Adoption will follow, and it’s safe to say that we have passed the tipping point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Flink is the future of streaming.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera’s perspective: Cloudera saw the increasing volumes of data our customers were moving via streams early on. They were suffering rising costs and were struggling to provide real-time insight to demanding stakeholders. So we bet big on Flink in 2020 and started developing tooling to bring it to the enterprise, and have a mature Flink product used by customers in banking, telco, manufacturing, and IT.  kSQLdb, Spark Structured Streaming, and other proprietary approaches that fall short of the truly open and distributed stateful stream processing capabilities that Flink brings to the table will likely decelerate.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2- But there is an intriguing new category of competitor emerging, the “streaming database”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There are a handful of vendors positioning streaming databases as an alternative to Flink for stream processing. Their core value proposition is that streaming databases are inherently faster than Flink due to in-memory processing and state management. This makes sense in theory, but there are pretty wild claims out there as far as just how much&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;faster they are, and with a lack of independent benchmarks in the industry a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted. But the tech is interesting and the allure of DB tooling that can “do-it-all” is strong. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera’s perspective: There is much value to be captured by bringing real-time processing capabilities to streaming architectures. Kafka-centric approaches leave a lot to be desired, most notably operational complexity and difficulty integrating batch data, so there is certainly a gap to be filled. Real-time databases have their place in the streaming ecosystem, but that place is in publishing and making the result sets widely available after a highly scalable engine like Flink has processed the data. Cloudera does this via materialized views that are accessible via API. Also, why solve for connectivity and data distribution again if it’s already solved for? How long does streaming data live inside the database and what happens when it expires? Is this yet another database? What about data lock-in? With highly interdependent capabilities, how difficult will it be to make modifications as business and data requirements evolve?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This class of technologies is very interesting, but still new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“wait and see” is perhaps sage advice.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3- Change data capture is red hot and Debezium is the de facto standard in this space &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Judging by the sheer number of questions from the audience about CDC in general and Debezium specifically, it’s safe to say that Debezium has become for CDC what Flink is for stream processing. It makes perfect sense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;similar to Flink, Debezium is an open source distributed service frequently used with Kafka to extend the value of streaming and capture new use cases. Debezium works by continuously reading the change logs of popular databases and publishing to Kafka topics, effectively transforming legacy batch systems into rich streams of data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Debezium does have certain complexities of course, namely resource management and schema evolution. But there is much value to be captured here.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera perspective: Data freshness matters. It’s difficult to imagine a use case where fresher data isn’t inherently better data. Change Data Capture is an important part of the streaming ecosystem. Cloudera supports Debezium connectors for Kconnect and Flink and will soon release a NiFi processor as well, giving users fine grain control over data distribution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4- Tooling for the Kafka ecosystem is improving &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It’s no secret that Kafka deployments can be quite complex. Setting up clusters, monitoring and managing brokers, partitions, and topics, handling message ordering, exactly once guarantees, schema evolution and security: these all add up to operational overhead. Data lineage and debugging can be a nightmare to unravel. As the streaming space grows in maturity one thing that stood out is the improved tooling in the space. Confluent’s future vision for the data portal is a great example of the effort to provide better tooling and smoother user experience around discoverability and governance. Many vendors are providing enhanced tooling to provide observability and improve performance or to extend the ecosystem by integrating other frameworks such as MQTT and Pulsar.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera perspective: Cloudera began providing support and building tooling for the Kafka ecosystem in 2015 and has developed stable enterprise solutions. The Streams Messaging Manager tool is included in our free community edition of Cloudera Streams Processing. Furthermore, Cloudera SDX provides an integrated set of security and governance tools across the entire data lifecycle, including streaming. The Kafka platform shifting from Zookeeper to Kraft as is a huge relief for anyone managing Kafka operations. KRaft is already in tech preview for our next release.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For these reasons and more, IBM recently chose Cloudera as strategic Kafka partner of choice to bring cost efficient, scalable solutions to our enterprise customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/ibm-technology-chooses-cloudera-as-its-preferred-partner-for-addressing-real-time-data-movement-using-kafka/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;https://blog.cloudera.com/ibm-technology-chooses-cloudera-as-its-preferred-partner-for-addressing-real-time-data-movement-using-kafka/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- There is still room for growth and maturation in the streaming space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;While adoption of streaming technologies has steadily increased, the average streaming maturity level is still in the early stages. Streaming maturity is not about simply streaming more data; it’s about weaving streaming data more deeply into operations to drive real-time utilization across the enterprise. The number of use cases supported by a single Kafka topic is a better indicator than a raw measure of volume like events per second. Surprisingly few users had multiple use cases for most of their Kafka topics. Another hallmark of streaming maturity is the efficiency of the entire system in terms of resource utilization and ease of developing or modifying new use cases. Real-time processing can significantly reduce the volume of data in the stream and that’s a good thing. The majority of data streamers are just beginning to experiment here.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;More forward-looking talks focused on expanding the impact of streaming data.  Real-time anomaly detection and other time series operations on event streams. Operationalizing python for real-time ML pipelines was a hot topic. Others focused on the big picture efficiency, looking for ways to reduce load on Kafka by integrating with Apache Pinot for example (link below to an NYC-based Meetup on this topic). There was conspicuously little content specific to generative AI, which was a bit surprising given the attention the industry at large has given the topic in 2023. Streaming data absolutely has a tremendous role to play in generative AI, in fine tuning foundational models, optimizing prompts, contextualizing and augmenting outputs, etc. Stay tuned for plenty more on that topic!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera perspective:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Data streams are part of a much broader data lifecycle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kafka can’t do it all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Kafka shines when utilized as the real-time bus for application integration and as the message buffer for analytics workflows. When stretched beyond those core capabilities however, it becomes overly complex and carries significant technical overhead. That’s why a complete approach to streaming is needed. An efficient and scalable streaming architecture should be simple yet complete with tooling to address continuous iterative development cycles.  That includes first class support for data distribution (&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/moving-enterprise-data-from-anywhere-to-any-system-made-easy/"&gt;aka universal data distribution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;), edge data capture, stream filtering, independently modifiable stream processing that is accessible to analysts, and integration with data at rest for low cost accessible storage. Lastly, real-time processing and movement of multi structured data including prompts and embeddings is critical for harnessing the transformative power of AI.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**总结**

本文介绍了Mike Rodden创建的AI-powered博客Softwine.ai，该博客结合了葡萄酒和技术领域，旨在促进这两个领域的跨界对话。Mike通过博客分享有关葡萄酒和技术的知识、观点和新闻，并探讨了AI在葡萄园管理和葡萄酒行业中的应用。AI在博客中发挥了重要作用，扮演图形设计师和文章大纲生成器的角色，帮助提高博客的效率。Mike使用Hostinger AI Website Builder搭建了他的网站，并赞赏了这个平台的简单易用和个性化功能。总体而言，Softwine.ai是一个充满激情的项目，旨在促进葡萄酒和技术两个领域之间的交流和思考。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Rodden is a software product manager from Boston with a hobby: he is the creative force behind &lt;a href="http://www.softwine.ai" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Softwine.ai&lt;/a&gt;, an AI-powered blog about wine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Softwine.ai combines two topics that may initially appear mutually exclusive – winemaking and technology. So when Mike writes about wine, it’s always through a modern lens, focused on the technological frontier of the industry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Mike had built a few websites before, he was looking for a simpler platform for his blog. Hostinger AI Website Builder was the ideal solution – its Plug&amp;#8217;n&amp;#8217;Play nature let Mike get his vision off the ground in no time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-vino-veritas"&gt;In Vino Veritas&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wine had always been a passion of Mike’s, but he became even more interested in it after learning about the Wine &amp;amp; Spirit Education Trust (WSET) program. It took two years to finish, and in September this year, Mike celebrated achieving his WSET certification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike started Softwine.ai as a way to bridge the gap between his hobby and profession. The blog allows him to share knowledge, opinions, and news in two contrasting areas – wine and technology – with aims to spark cross-conversation in both arenas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Softwine illustration. " class="wp-image-5635" height="610" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/softwine-art-1024x610.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The wine industry is a little bit traditional – they don&amp;#8217;t adapt to technology super well,” Mike reveals. “But there are some wineries that are really embracing it. They&amp;#8217;re doing some cool stuff, like using data analytics to predict when they have to use chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the kind of subject matter you can expect on Softwine.ai. The blog covers topics like AI technology’s role in integrated pest management (IPM), using weather data to manage vineyards, whether computers can replace sommeliers, and so on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog has also become an effective way to stimulate Mike’s creativity, which would otherwise remain untapped.&amp;nbsp; Since his day job doesn’t provide him with many opportunities to put pen to paper, the blog is a great way to fill the gap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The majority of my day-to-day is more product marketing than actual engineering. Content writing was something I hadn&amp;#8217;t practiced in a long time. So it&amp;#8217;s been a cool way to both practice a little bit and have a creative outlet,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-the-best-collaborator"&gt;AI – The Best Collaborator&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike is the only person behind the blog, with AI having a big enough impact to be featured as a contributor on &lt;a href="https://www.softwine.ai/team" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Softwine.ai’s Team page&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Softwine illustration." class="wp-image-5636" height="574" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/softwine-art-2-1024x574.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, AI is the blog’s graphic designer – it comes up with imaginative illustrations and helps Softwine.ai establish a unique and authentic look. Mike also uses AI-generative technology for article outlines and content creation. As a result, Mike can be more efficient with the limited amount of time he can dedicate to the blog – keeping a close eye on output as part of the editing process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These AI models are actually coming up with ideas I never would have thought of. It could be something I’d never heard of in the wine industry before but then you look it up, and there are so many fresh topics I wouldn’t have been aware of otherwise,” Mike smiles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It does take a good amount of work to make a decent post. But the ability to quickly come up with an outline to just throw your ideas in an order that makes sense – that kind of thing definitely saves a ton of time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hostinger-ai-website-builder-experience"&gt;The Hostinger AI Website Builder Experience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike also used the powers of AI to get the site off the ground. He came across the Hostinger Website Builder when searching online for an accessible platform that wouldn’t be too complex to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’d used other builders and content management systems before to build a couple of websites, and it wasn&amp;#8217;t super impressive. I was looking for something a little bit more out of the box,” Mike reveals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having used Hostinger Website Builder’s AI functionality right off the bat, Mike was impressed with how simple it was to customize the layout of the site and make adjustments on the go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I really like how easy it is to adjust any grid lines and spacing. Everything I do seems to be one or two clicks away at the most, which is great,” Mike says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And since site management is so effortless, Mike can dedicate his time to what matters most – creating standout content for his blog. He doesn’t need to worry about website performance, either – his AI-powered blog is lightweight and loads fast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-days-of-wine-and-roses"&gt;Days of Wine and Roses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the blog is still relatively new, Mike expects its traffic to grow organically in the coming months. He doesn’t rely on paid advertisements to spread awareness; instead, he’s implementing SEO strategies to help Softwine.ai climb the search ranks and bring more visitors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Softwine illustration." class="wp-image-5637" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/softwine-art-3-1024x683.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike isn’t planning to monetize the blog because he wants it to remain a passion project and eventually turn it into a medium for learning. Most important of all is the blog’s natural ability to spark conversation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wine and technology don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of overlap in general. I want to get both camps interested in one another. For that, I like to pick out topics that will make people think and inspire debate. This is especially important since when it comes to wine, people can be a little stubborn in adapting to new things,” Mike says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the reason why Mike doesn’t shy away from controversial subjects – it’s all about giving people food (or drink) for thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get your passion project off the ground in minutes with Hostinger Website Builder, just like Mike did. Start building now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/website-builder?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=clientstories&amp;amp;utm_campaign=intext&amp;amp;utm_content=20231017-softwine-website-builder" rel="follow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-5640" height="300" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/Website-Builder_in-text-banner-1024x300.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Do you feel exhausted after interacting with people? Do you tend to have many thoughts but express them rarely? If so, there&amp;#8217;s no need to stress: you might just be an introvert, and that&amp;#8217;s perfectly fine. Although it might seem that the world is full of extroverted personalities, a &lt;a href="https://www.themyersbriggs.com/en-US/Connect-With-Us/Blog/2020/January/World-Introvert-Day-2020"&gt;significant portion&lt;/a&gt; of the global population is introverted, with some estimates reaching up to 56%. Being introverted is a natural aspect of your personality, akin to having a distinct character trait. Recognize that being introverted doesn&amp;#8217;t necessitate fixing or change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;#8217;ll explore valuable tips and strategies that can help introverts not only navigate but also thrive and excel in the software industry. We&amp;#8217;ll offer practical advice that has proven effective, empowering introverts to embrace their strengths and succeed in this dynamic field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-introversion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Introversion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the main content, let&amp;#8217;s understand the concept of introversion. The &lt;a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/introversion"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; defines introversion as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An orientation toward the internal private world of one’s self and one’s inner thoughts and feelings, rather than toward the outer world of people and things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To elaborate, introversion describes individuals who prefer spending time alone or with a few close friends rather than in large social settings. Introverts find solace and inspiration in solitude, and excessive social interaction can be draining for them. They excel in activities that require deep concentration, introspective thinking, and self-rejuvenation. Introversion is simply a natural characteristic of some individuals, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the definition of introversion might lead some to mistakenly think that all introverts are self-centered and reserved. Just like anyone else, introverts have diverse personalities, behaviors, and interests. While extroverts might thrive in large social gatherings and draw energy from external stimuli, introverts may find such situations overwhelming. Importantly, introverts often demonstrate extroverted qualities within their imagination. They bring to social dynamics thoughtful insights, careful analysis, and a calm perspective, enriching interactions in profound ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="characteristics-of-introverts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of Introverts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An introverted individual might exhibit the following traits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preference for solitude&lt;/strong&gt;: They value personal space, which allows them self-reflection, deep thinking, and growth. It&amp;#8217;s a time for rejuvenation, not loneliness.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective socialization&lt;/strong&gt;: They excel in one-on-one settings, prioritizing meaningful connections over large gatherings.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preference for written communication&lt;/strong&gt;: They often communicate better in writing, taking the time to craft their words.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoidance of the limelight&lt;/strong&gt;: They generally feel more at ease in less spotlight-focused environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active listening and observation&lt;/strong&gt;: Their attentive listening is invaluable, making them thoughtful participants in conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Paulo Coelho, a Brazillian novelist, once expressed &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7187940-blessed-are-those-who-do-not-fear-solitude-who-are"&gt;his perspective on solitude&lt;/a&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blessed are those who do not fear solitude, who are not afraid of their own company, who are not always desperately looking for something to do, something to amuse themselves with, something to judge. If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Paulo Coelho&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s discuss how to leverage introversion as a strength in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embracing Introversion in Tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing your introverted qualities is crucial in the tech industry. Introverts often think independently, forming unique perspectives. Whether this stems from a love of solitude or frequent alone time, it&amp;#8217;s a trait that can inspire disruptive ideas and innovations. So, harness this power to flourish in tech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, several successful entrepreneurs, such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Marissa Mayer, Larry Page, and Elon Musk, identify as introverts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a Q&amp;amp;A session, Bill Gates was once questioned about his success in a world that is predominantly extroverted,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/05/bill-gates-how-to-succeed-as-an-introvert/"&gt;shared his perspective on being an introvert&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I think introverts can do quite well. If you’re clever you can learn to get the benefits of being an introvert, which might be, say, being willing to go off for a few days and think about a tough problem, read everything you can, push yourself very hard to think out on the edge of that area. Then, if you come up with something, if you want to hire people, get them excited, build a company around that idea, you better learn what extroverts do, you better hire some extroverts, like Steve Ballmer I would claim as an extrovert, and tap into both sets of skills in order to have a company that thrives both as in deep thinking and building teams and going out into the world to sell those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-a-supportive-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a Supportive Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a misconception to assume all introverts avoid networking. Networking isn&amp;#8217;t exclusive to extroverts; introverts, with their active listening, observation, and genuine curiosity, can also excel in building relationships. Remember, introversion doesn&amp;#8217;t limit career success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Platforms like LinkedIn offer a space for expanding professional networks. Joining forums, tech communities, and social media groups can also help. Within the workplace, seeking mentors and peer support, especially from those who understand introversion, can be invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="navigating-teamwork-and-collaboration"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating Teamwork and Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re familiar with modern software development practices, you&amp;#8217;ll know that many teams implement Agile methodologies. In the software industry, teamwork and collaboration form the cornerstone of daily operations. Engaging in discussions is essential to various aspects of the development process. While tasks like coding and documentation can be done individually, many activities rely on group conversations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In software development:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design is a collective process involving team discussions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Architecture decisions arise from discussions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pair and mob programming encourage collaboration and team dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Code and pull request reviews involve feedback exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Scrum rituals, such as daily stand-ups and retrospectives, use discussions to align the team and refine the development process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For introverts, these routines can initially seem daunting. Agile demands frequent team interactions, brainstorming sessions, and daily stand-ups, which can be socially taxing. The perpetual need for social interaction can sap their energy. Moreover, introverts might struggle to express their thoughts in larger group settings because they tend to reflect deeply before speaking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a manager, your responsibility includes fostering an inclusive environment for introverts. Individuals in leadership roles should recognize and accommodate introverted team members. Understand that they might not always feel at ease speaking in group settings. Consider implementing anonymous communication channels or feedback methods. Regular check-ins with introverted team members can ensure they remain engaged. Such actions show care, motivating them to commit and deliver quality work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By cultivating psychological safety, introverts will feel more confident sharing their ideas. This nurtures a collaborative atmosphere, incorporating varied viewpoints from the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mastering-communication-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Communication Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not uncommon for introverts to receive feedback during performance evaluations suggesting greater visibility. This might be a nuanced way of advising them to vocalize their achievements more. It could also indicate that honing communication skills could be advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding this feedback is essential. However, adapting to it shouldn&amp;#8217;t mean forsaking one&amp;#8217;s introverted nature. Improving visibility isn&amp;#8217;t about imitating extroverted tendencies; it&amp;#8217;s about effectively communicating while staying authentic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can enhance your communication by practicing active listening, preparing thoughts beforehand, and being concise. Prioritizing written communication can also be advantageous, allowing clearer articulation of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enhancing communication as an introvert is about striking a balance. It involves utilizing unique strengths to convey ideas and accomplishments effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cultivating-a-growth-mindset"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating a Growth Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The software industry is ever-evolving, with new trends and technologies emerging regularly. Success demands not only a foundation in computer science fundamentals (for certain roles) but also a growth mindset and a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills"&gt;T-shaped &lt;/a&gt;approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;T-shaped developers possess deep expertise in one discipline (the vertical bar of the T) and broader, albeit shallower, knowledge in related fields (the horizontal bar). This model suggests that while having a specialty is crucial, versatility is also valuable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adopting a growth mindset entails actively seeking learning opportunities and viewing challenges as growth prospects. In simpler terms, it&amp;#8217;s the belief that abilities and intelligence can evolve through dedication, practice, and learning. To thrive in tech, remain open to new experiences, such as industry conferences, workshops, or online courses. Familiarizing yourself with emerging tools and technologies not only broadens your horizons but also helps connect with peers who have similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combining a growth mindset with a T-shaped approach ensures adaptability in the tech landscape, fostering continuous learning and relevance in software development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this article underscores the importance of understanding introversion as an intrinsic trait rather than a shortcoming. It&amp;#8217;s crucial for organizations to value independent thought and individual perspectives, enabling introverts to introduce innovative ideas. To succeed in the software domain, introverts must harness their distinctive qualities. Recognizing and leveraging these traits can lead to valuable contributions and a flourishing career in the software sector.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microspeak: The As-Appropriate (AA) interviewer</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231017-00/?p=108897</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One term you may hear when people talk about the process of interviewing at Microsoft is the As Appropriate, or AA, interviewer. Why is the final interview of the day called As Appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name is a holdover from how Microsoft used to structure hiring interviews. The term is not officially used any more, but you may still hear it used informally by old-timers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical interview day used to consist of four (sometimes five) interviews, structured as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Start&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;br /&gt;
(as appropriate)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇒&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Recruiter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇒&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇑&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇗&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan="3"&gt;⇐ ⇐ ⇐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of interviews is called an &lt;i&gt;interview loop&lt;/i&gt; because the candidate travels in a loop through the diagram, starting and ending with the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the interviews assesses not just the candidate&amp;#8217;s technical competence but also other factors such as their initiative, ability to teach themselves new things, and how well they work as part of a team. The results of these interviews are all shared with the recruiter and the final interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final interviewer was typically someone more senior in the hiring group. Historically, their job was to take the information provided by the initial interviewers and, based on their recommendations, decide whether the candidate was still worth pursuing. If so, then they proceeded with the final interview. if not, then they sent the candidate directly to the recruiter after completing their final &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; interview. The final interviewer was called the &amp;#8220;as appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer because the final interview took place only if they felt it was appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;#8220;as appropriate&amp;#8221; was often abbreviated in speech to &amp;#8220;as-app&amp;#8221; (pronouncing the &amp;#8220;app&amp;#8221; like the first syllable of &amp;#8220;application&amp;#8221;), and in writing as &amp;#8220;AA&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft hiring interview process has been reworked several times since those early days. For example, at one point, the interviews were restructured so that the interviewer roles are rotated through the day, to improve throughput:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Welcome&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 4&lt;br /&gt;
(as-app)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every interviewer serves as the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer for a candidate. There is no special interviewer who is responsible for being the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the evolution of the interview loop, the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; stopped being optional. Everybody got an &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interview. The role of the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer didn&amp;#8217;t change. It&amp;#8217;s just that the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interview always takes place, regardless of the feedback from the other three interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final interview of the day lost the name &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221;, but people who have been conducting interviews for a long time sometimes accidentally slip into the old terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

Read on for the latest news fraud findings from Sift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Account takeovers skyrocket &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five consumers recently surveyed by Sift have experienced account takeover (ATO) attacks, with 62% of those taking place in the past year. The prevalence of these types of attacks is supported by Sift’s latest &lt;a href="https://resources.sift.com/ebook/q3-2023-digital-trust-safety-index-account-takeover-data-consumer-insights-and-emerging-trends/"&gt;Q3 Digital Trust &amp;amp; Safety Index&lt;/a&gt; findings which reveal a staggering 354% year-over-year increase in ATO in Q2 2023 across Sift’s global network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While AI has been a hot topic in the fraud prevention industry, it’s automation that’s still driving the speed and scale of many of these attacks, with the sale of bots that provide ‘ATO-as-a-Service’ for purchase on the deep web.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fraud becomes as sophisticated as the technology being used to commit it,” says Rebecca Alter, Trust and Safety Architect at Sift, “and increasingly innovative types of automation pose a threat to merchants that aren’t ready to match its speed or account for its accessibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Explore more highlights from the report in &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/e-commerce-fraud-to-cost-48-billion-globally-this-year-as-attacks-skyrocket-report-says/"&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sift’s newest integrations and automation capabilities &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With fraudsters collaborating and networking across borders as part of a full-fledged &lt;a href="https://sift.com/fraud-center/fraud-schemes"&gt;Fraud Economy&lt;/a&gt;, Sift is committed to expanding its risk management capabilities to a wider network of fraud fighters. The most recent example of this effort is Sift’s new Dispute Management integrations with PayPal and Adyen, two of the largest payment processors globally. With the combination of Sift’s &lt;a href="https://blog.sift.com/payment-protection-and-dispute-management/"&gt;Dispute Management and Payment Protection solutions&lt;/a&gt;, users can improve the overall payment experience and reduce potential fraud or disputes for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sift Dispute Management has made it faster and easier to respond to chargebacks. Effective integration between Sift, our payment processor, and our own internal tools has improved a once labor intensive process into an efficient, automated system,” said Taylor Snyder, Manager of Risk &amp;amp; Compliance at online bill pay company, Doxo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More industry and customer recognition for Sift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the &lt;a href="https://blog.sift.com/sift-2023-forrester-wave-digital-fraud-management/"&gt;recognition as a ‘Leader’&lt;/a&gt; in the latest Forrester Wave report, Sift also earned accolades from &lt;a href="https://www.marketplacerisk.com/post/marketplace-risk-recognizes-solution-provider-excellence-program-honorees"&gt;Marketplace Risk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/09/15/2744127/0/en/Sift-Named-a-Leader-in-Fraud-Detection-E-commerce-Fraud-Detection-and-Risk-Based-Authentication-on-G2.html"&gt;G2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sift was recognized as one of the top fraud prevention and chargeback management solutions by Marketplace Risk’s Solution Provider Excellence program, which is intended to help marketplaces and digital platforms in selecting solution providers with a proven track record of success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;G2, the largest and most trusted software marketplace, released their Fall 2023 Reports revealing Sift as the only fraud solution provider to have earned Leader status in all three key fraud prevention categories: Fraud Detection, E-Commerce Fraud Detection, and Risk-Based Authentication. G2 rankings are based on authentic customer reviews and scores; Sift’s ranking is based on over 180 authentic Sift user ratings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is one recent review: &amp;#8220;Sift is the partner of choice for fraud prevention. Sift is one of the few tools in our software stacks that has such a clear ROI. We have total transparency with our entire order pipeline to prevent fraudulent purchases. The UI is intuitive and the rules-based engine makes creating and editing rules on the fly a breeze.”&lt;/p&gt;

**大纲：**
- 介绍SCARF及其重要性和影响

- 依赖范围的确定和删除路线图的创建
- 动态和静态分析的使用
- 自动化和人工干预的结合

**总结：**
本文介绍了Meta公司的Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF)以及其在产品释放方面的重要性和影响。SCARF为工程师提供了指导，并结合自动化技术减轻了工程师的负担。文章指出了产品释放的复杂性和潜在的失败模式，并介绍了SCARF如何通过工作流管理和删除路线图的创建来解决这些问题。文章还介绍了动态和静态分析技术在SCARF中的应用，以及自动化和人工干预之间的结合。通过SCARF的使用，Meta公司成功地删除了大量的无用数据和代码，提高了产品和服务的质量。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF) is Meta&amp;#8217;s unused code and data deletion framework.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF guides engineers through deprecating a product safely and efficiently via an internal tool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF combines this tooling with automation to reduce load on engineers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At Meta, we are constantly innovating and experimenting by building and shipping many different products, and those products comprise thousands of individual features. As part of this healthy technology lifecycle, it is inevitable that certain products or features will be deprecated. For example, in 2015 we launched a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2015/06/introducing-moments/"&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;photo-sharing app called Moments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, which was later deprecated in 2019. So, how did we efficiently and safely remove all of the code and data related to Moments without adversely affecting Meta&amp;#8217;s other products and services?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this three-part blog series, we will discuss the complexities involved in removing a product from a complex portfolio of products and the framework Meta has built to drive the automation of this process, our Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF). SCARF has had an important impact at Meta. In the last year, it has removed petabytes of unused data across &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;12.8M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; different data types stored in 21 different data systems. Over the last five years it has deleted over 100M lines of code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The first post will introduce the complexities faced when systematically deprecating products safely in a large organization and the internal workflow tools we have developed. The second post will explain how SCARF automates the removal of dead code and the infrastructure that powers it. The third post will discuss SCARF&amp;#8217;s orchestration for safely identifying and deleting unused data types across various data systems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Failure modes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Without established guidance detailing the process for determining when and how to remove a product or feature, a few failure modes might emerge. Consider the example of launching a time-specific feature for a large event that happens once every few years. Does it make sense to keep all the code and data related to it until the next event? Most of the time, maintaining code for a number of years that is unused is less desirable than building a new experience for the next event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Engineers who do attempt the cleanup might find that doing so is a very time-consuming job. Correctly identifying all the pieces of code and data associated with the product and only taking action on those specific pieces of code and data is a laborious process. It’s possible that a table that is still being used, or code that is still required for a shared use case, could be included in the scope of a deletion effort. For example, some tables might be shared between products. Hypothetically, Moments may have started life as an extension to Facebook photos before it became a separate app.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Most importantly, it&amp;#8217;s crucial that any cleanup efforts only remove things that are actively being deprecated or are already entirely unused. Deleting something that is actively being used in production could cause bad experiences for users. The interconnected nature of features within a large product like Facebook makes this a very real possibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;How did we solve this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Meta has developed playbooks describing how to safely deprecate a product. These playbooks describe how to notify people and give them time to download their data, how to disable the product safely, and when to eventually delete the underlying code and data. They describe how and when to perform a product or feature deprecation, but actually removing the code and data for a product or feature is an engineering problem with an engineering solution. The engineering solution we have built does not replace these guides, but enables engineers to more safely and efficiently complete the product deprecation process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this post, we’ll describe Meta&amp;#8217;s SCARF and how it guides engineers through this cleanup process. In subsequent posts, we will discuss its limitations and how they are mitigated by our automated dead code and data removal platforms. To start, we introduce Meta&amp;#8217;s suite of internal tools developed to orchestrate both of these systems in guiding engineers to remove large products with complex dependencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Introducing workflow management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To simplify the task of removing a product, Meta has built a product deprecation workflow management tool into SCARF to help engineers delete a product&amp;#8217;s dead code and unused data safely and efficiently. This tool lets engineers understand and break down the steps they’ll go through during the deprecation and coordinates the actions of SCARF to bring automation to bear with an engineer&amp;#8217;s guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Engineers can import their product or feature into SCARF, which then determines the constituent pieces of code and data, and identifies internal and external dependencies on these assets. SCARF automatically processes this information to guide engineers on the correct order of operations to delete assets safely and shows their progress relative to the desired end-state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Any assets that are safe to be deleted immediately will be handled by SCARF&amp;#8217;s automated code and data cleanup systems (which will be covered in more depth in our subsequent blog posts). Engineers are able to track this automation and accelerate it by using their domain knowledge combined with SCARF&amp;#8217;s scoping analysis, which determines the assets that are safe to remove. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Scoping the deprecation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Understanding when a piece of code or data is used by other components of a product is important, and detecting when an asset is referenced in the codebase of other products is crucial for a safe deprecation (the internal and external dependencies, respectively). For example, we would not want to leave a dead web link between two different products because that could lead to a bad user experience. An engineer deprecating a product must think carefully about each such dependency in the external boundary of their product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To avoid these complications, engineers begin their deprecations by scoping the project, recursively adding any assets that should be deleted, and flagging dependencies that should be severed. For example, if Moments had an integration with the Facebook app’s Sharing feature, this dependency must be broken because the Facebook Sharing feature itself may not be in scope for removal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20690" height="491" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image1.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;However, if the Sharing feature was unique to Moments, that would change the scope of removal as we would want to delete that component as well. Adding new assets into the scope of the project as it progresses requires further analysis to discover the new boundaries of the internal and external dependencies. These dependencies are expected to change over time as an engineer discovers extra components to delete. Alternatively, we may identify code that is actually a shared component and should not be deleted. Attempting to finalize this boundary from the start is very difficult, so we allow developers to redefine the boundary over time as the deprecation progresses to reflect this growing understanding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The graph of components, their internal and external dependencies, and related data assets, can grow extremely complex in large products. SCARF simplifies this problem by only requiring engineers to make “Flag Dependency” or “Add to Project” decisions at the boundaries. It then internally computes the correct deletion order for everything inside the project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20691" height="577" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image2.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Creating a deletion roadmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Once the set of unused assets to be deleted has been determined, SCARF will analyze the internal and external dependencies and create a deletion roadmap that outlines the correct sequence of steps for deleting everything safely. The roadmap is refreshed each day as changes are made, either from targeted assets being deleted or from modifications to the component graph through the Flag and Add actions. This roadmap is one of the workflow management tool&amp;#8217;s most crucial features. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Without guidance, engineers may attempt to delete everything in one fell swoop by removing an entire code directory without accounting for external systems’ dependencies, where changes cannot be committed atomically. Another example includes deleting data before the code that reads and writes it, which may lead to new data being created that must be cleaned again. Deprecations must be staggered to account for these various requirements and this entails that every deprecation be performed in a coordinated, multi-step process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The key implementation detail is the encoding of business logic that allows products and apps to function in Meta&amp;#8217;s systems. By encoding how users are able to engage with products and how those products communicate with other Meta services, we can ensure that upstream assets are always deleted before their dependencies. For example, typically a product will comprise code in many different languages across multiple repositories. An engineer needs to delete their mobile code (Java, Objective-C) in order to free up and delete their server-side GraphQL definitions. Deleting those GraphQL definitions makes it possible to delete business logic; deleting business logic makes it possible to delete data schema definitions, which in turn allows unused data to be deleted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The following diagram is a hypothetical example of the type of information that is presented to an engineer in their deletion roadmap. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20692" height="997" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image3.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This sequencing isn&amp;#8217;t obvious at the get-go! The links between these system boundaries are often weaker than the link between, for example, two classes in the same language; and the link may often only be discovered by an engineer during continuous testing on their code change requests. SCARF&amp;#8217;s encoding of these inter-system boundaries enables the deletion roadmap which in turn enables engineers to stagger their removal actions safely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Powering the analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF’s workflow management tool is powered by detailed metrics from a combination of both static and dynamic analysis. Information about code is gathered from SCARF’s unified code dependency graph and information about data is gathered from SCARF’s asset usage analysis. These mechanisms will be discussed in more detail in our subsequent blog posts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;These metrics give the workflow management tool a very important property: If metrics can be found for an asset, it is in use and should be blocked from automated deletion. Correspondingly, any asset for which no metrics are available is ready for automatic deletion. With these metrics in hand, SCARF can show engineers a precise explanation of exactly what is blocking the automation and what steps they must manually perform in order for the automation to proceed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This completeness property allows SCARF to automatically begin removing code and data that is unused, while simultaneously showing engineers which things must be handled manually. At every step of the process, both engineers and automation work together to complete the deprecation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Once an engineer has acted upon this information and removed more dead code and unused data in accordance with the deletion roadmap, the continuous indexing and analysis of SCARF will detect these changes and automatically trigger any code/data cleanup it can. Finally, the workflow management tool will update its deletion roadmap to identify the next set of items requiring manual intervention, and the process is repeated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20693" height="582" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image4.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Is automation sufficient?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Some of the usage signals SCARF highlights (such as API endpoints that still receive traffic) do not necessarily cause compilation errors if they are ignored and are more subjective as to whether they should stop automated deletion. If the endpoint for a product receives a single request each day, should we delete it right away? We have already identified that the endpoint belongs to a product we are removing so we know it should be removed eventually, but the answer to when it is correct to delete it is ultimately a business decision. Further, we understand that mistakes can happen and that the automation is not expected to be 100 percent perfect. Therefore, SCARF errs on the side of caution as a mistaken deletion could lead to unrecoverable errors or data loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Correspondingly, SCARF offers the ability to override signals that prevent automation from taking action. In the example above, an engineer might decide we wish to proceed with deleting the API endpoint despite small amounts of traffic. This is extremely valuable when cleaning up internal products, tools, and services. Internal tools are built and deprecated with a much faster cadence than an external product often is and SCARF can help determine each individual internal user of a tool who needs to be asked if they’re agreeable with it being removed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This feature creates a feedback loop between engineers and automation. Our automation highlights usage signals; engineers then triage those usage signals (either by modifying code to remove them or, if applicable, marking the signal as not sufficient to block deletion); then our automation can proceed to progress the SCARF project. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To further accelerate manual changes performed by engineers, SCARF also provides an instant code change feature. SCARF suggests a means for breaking a dependency through a targeted code change and an engineer is able to select one of a predetermined set of possible ways to break it. The change is immediately previewable and a change request can be immediately generated for review by other engineers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;After an engineer has progressed through a majority of the deletion roadmap and removed the entry points, client code, server code, and any other in-scope assets, they will be left with unused tables of data that can now be automatically cleaned up by SCARF. This automation will be explained in more detail in our future blog posts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Integration with other tools at Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF is useful for more than just product deprecation. We surface deprecation as an option when notifying engineers about routine maintenance or upgrade work on individual assets. For example, when asking developers to migrate away from a legacy internal API, we can include an option for them to deprecate the callsite or affected product and import their code into SCARF. Deprecating something can, in many cases, be more work than performing a simple upgrade, but deprecation means that no future maintenance work is necessary. Once something has been removed, future maintenance costs go to zero.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We hope you’ll look forward to our subsequent posts in the series, which will cover SCARF&amp;#8217;s automated code and data deletion, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

此篇文章介绍了Amazon CodeWhisperer的定制化功能，它可以根据私有代码库为开发人员生成特定的代码推荐。目前现有的AI编码协助工具通常只能基于开源代码进行训练，无法定制化，这给开发人员带来了一系列挑战。而Amazon CodeWhisperer的定制化功能允许组织自定义代码推荐，包括私有库中的内部库、API、包、类和方法。通过连接GitHub、GitLab或BitBucket等代码库，管理员可以创建定制化，并在团队成员的IDE中获取实时的定制化代码推荐。这项功能有助于提高开发人员的生产力，并确保代码的质量和安全性。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;An AI coding companion, such as &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/"&gt;Amazon CodeWhisperer&lt;/a&gt;, aims to improve developers’ productivity by helping them write code quickly and securely. However, in particular cases, developers need to have code recommendations based on their internal libraries and APIs they extensively use every day.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As most of the existing AI coding companion tools are trained only on open-source codes, they lack the capability to customize the code recommendations using private code repositories. This limitation presents a variety of challenges for developers. Developers have a difficulty learning how to use internal libraries correctly and avoid security problems. For large codebases, it requires hours of reading documentation to understand what code needs to be written to complete the task.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now in Preview — &amp;nbsp;Amazon CodeWhisperer Customization Capability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I’m excited to announce Amazon CodeWhisperer customization capability (in preview) that enables organizations to customize CodeWhisperer to generate specific code recommendations from private code repositories. With this feature, developers who are part of &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-prof-devs.html"&gt;Amazon CodeWhisperer Professional&lt;/a&gt; tier can now receive real-time code recommendations that include their internal libraries, APIs, packages, classes, and methods.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you’re a developer working for a hypothetical food delivery company called AnyCompany. You’re given a task to process a list of unassigned food deliveries around the driver’s current location. Previously, with CodeWhisperer, it would not know the correct internal APIs to process unassigned food deliveries or getting driver’s current location as this isn’t publicly available information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now, with customization capability, you can ask CodeWhisperer to provide recommendations that include specific code related to the company’s internal services. The following screenshot shows how CodeWhisperer generates codes based on the internal codebase just by writing a set of comments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-code.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75995 size-full" height="560" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-code.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="813" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the customization capability of utilizing your internal codebase, CodeWhisperer now understands the intent, determines which internal and public APIs are best suited to the task, and generates code recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How It Works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The explanation above described how you can use CodeWhisperer customization capability as a developer. Now, let me share how it works and how you can get started.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-1-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75782" height="586" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-1-1-1024x586.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To create a customization, you need to complete the following steps as a CodeWhisperer administrator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Administer your end users as &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/as-whisper-admin.html"&gt;CodeWhisperer administrator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Connect to existing repositories. You can connect one or more code repositories in your GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket account using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; Connections or manually upload all of your codes into an &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)&lt;/a&gt; bucket.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create a customization. CodeWhisperer will customize its model based on your codebase.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Activate the customization for your team members. Once the customization is created, you can review and manually activate the customization to make it available automatically in your team members’ IDEs.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This capability provides two main advantages: providing real-time customized code recommendations that are specific to organizations and ensuring the protection of valuable intellectual property. Organizations can now promote the use of code that meets their quality and security standards based on their codes in existing repositories.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, CodeWhisperer helps to ensure the security of your codes by providing the option to encrypt your customization data using customer managed keys in &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"&gt;AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)&lt;/a&gt;. This customization data will be deleted once the customization job finishes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me show you how you can use the Amazon CodeWhisperer customization capability.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get started, I need to create a customization. I need to have administrator access to navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Create customization &lt;/strong&gt;page on the Amazon CodeWhisperer dashboard.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-2-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75991 size-large" height="1024" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-2-1-754x1024.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="754" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Create customization&lt;/strong&gt; page, I can connect the desired private code repositories I want CodeWhisperer to train. Currently, CodeWhisperer customization capability supports connection to GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket via &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; Connections. If I have codes that are not in any code repositories, I can also manually upload my codes into an S3 bucket and define the Amazon S3 URI.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot shows that I have existing connections with my code repositories using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; Connections. I can also create a new connection by selecting&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Create new connection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-3-1-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75993 size-large" height="625" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-3-1-1-1024x625.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then, I can select&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Create Customization&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;so CodeWhisperer can start training the model based on the codes available in the connection. The duration to complete this process depends on the size of the code repositories.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-4-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75994 size-large" height="846" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-4-1-1024x846.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When the customization is ready, CodeWhisperer will not activate it automatically. This gives me the flexibility to activate the customizations just when I need them. But before I demonstrate that, I’d like to explain the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;score.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In short, the evaluation score helps me to measure the customization’s accuracy in predicting and providing code recommendations based on the codes in my code repositories. It provides a score in one of three categories: 1) Very Good, with a score ranging from 7–10; 2) Fair, with a score ranging from 4–7; and 3) Poor, with a score ranging from 0–4. It’s recommended to activate the customization if the evaluation score is 6 or higher. If the evaluation score is less than desired, I need to make sure that I’m providing enough codes for customization and provide a new code dataset that extensively contains references to internal APIs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here, I can see the &lt;strong&gt;Evaluation score&lt;/strong&gt; for my customization is 8, and I’m happy with this result. Then, I can select&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Activate&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to start using this customization.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75777" height="488" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-4-1024x488.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once I have activated the customizations, I can define the access to selected customizations by selecting&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Add users&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, I can give access to the customizations for selected team members who have been added as users for Amazon CodeWhisperer Professional tier. To do that, I can follow the guide from &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/as-whisper-admin.html"&gt;the&amp;nbsp;Administering end users&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-6.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75778" height="654" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-6-1024x654.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then, once my team members sign in via AWS Toolkit in their IDEs, they will see the available customizations and can start using them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-8.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75977 size-large" height="542" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-8-1024x542.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With Amazon CodeWhisperer, I can create multiple customizations by providing different code repositories. This feature is useful if I want to build customizations for code recommendations for certain teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-9-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75984 size-large" height="293" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-9-1-1024x293.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As administrator, I can also monitor the performance of each of the customizations by navigating to the CodeWhisperer dashboard page. This page summarizes useful data such as user activity, how many lines of code were suggested by CodeWhisperer and accepted by my team members, and how many security scans have successfully been run from IDEs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-7.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75779" height="647" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-7-1024x647.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Amazon CodeWhisperer customization capability also follows the supported IDEs as part of AWS Toolkit by Amazon CodeWhisperer, such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ JetBrains, Visual Studio, and AWS Cloud9. This feature also provides support for most popular programming languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build Lightning Web Components Faster with Code Snippets</title>
      <link>https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2023/10/build-lightning-web-components-faster-with-code-snippets.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implementing &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components"&gt;Salesforce Base Lightning Web Components&lt;/a&gt; just got easier with the addition of HTML Code Snippets in &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode"&gt;the Salesforce Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt; for Visual Studio Code (v58.6.2). This update complements JavaScript and Apex Code Snippets which have been a part of the VS Code extension since 2018. The introduction of HTML Code Snippets allows developers to produce the boilerplate markup required for an LWC and fill in the property values without having to pivot between their editor and documentation. By using Code Snippets, developers will no longer forget a property, misspell a component name, or leave out ARIA elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will explain what Code Snippets are, how to use them, and how you can build your own for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are Code Snippets?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this blog focuses on Code Snippets for HTML, they can be written and scoped to any language. Code Snippets leverage IntelliSense to offer robust code-completion options directly in VS Code. What makes Code Snippets different from traditional code completion/hinting tools is their ability to contain large blocks of code or markup with designated points for customization. When a code snippet is inserted into your file, pre-defined sections are made available to enter variable names, adjust properties, or pick from a list of values — all while keeping your hands on the keyboard. The blocks of code provide handy default values as you might find in developer documentation, further allowing you to speed along in the development process. Default implementations serve as a way to encourage best practices and reduce needless back and forth during code review. With Code Snippets, developers spend less time writing boilerplate code and more time adjusting the settings that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Snippets really demonstrate their power when you see them in action. Take for example a custom component that displays a Lightning Button Menu. To produce this functionality, the developer creates a parent Lightning Button Menu, nests a template, and iterates over the list of Menu Items which produces this code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;pre language="html"&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;lightning-button-menu
alternative-text="Show menu"
menu-alignment="auto"
&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;template for:each={myMenuItems} for:item="menuItem"&amp;amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;lt;lightning-menu-item
    key={menuItem.id}
    value={menuItem.value}
    label={menuItem.label}
    &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/lightning-menu-item&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;/template&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;/lightning-button-menu&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with our screen recording video below in which the developer uses Code Snippets to quickly produce the same block of code. With a few quick keystrokes, the outer Lightning Button Menu, for-loop, and corresponding Menu Item tags are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Code Snippets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML Code Snippets were introduced in version 58.6.2 of the &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode"&gt;Salesforce Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt; for VS Code and cover &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components"&gt;Salesforce Base Lightning Web Components&lt;/a&gt;. With your desired file open in the editor, you can search for code snippets in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the VS Code command palette and run the Insert Snippet command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open an HTML file in VS Code and begin typing the component name, for example &lt;code&gt;pill&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, type the component name, &lt;code&gt;pill&lt;/code&gt;. A menu appears showing multiple &lt;code&gt;lwc-pill&lt;/code&gt; components that offer implementation variations that coincide with &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-pill/example"&gt;component library examples&lt;/a&gt;. Select &lt;code&gt;lwc-pill-avatar&lt;/code&gt; by clicking the name or highlighting the option and hitting the tab on the keyboard. Immediately, the markup will paste into the editor and the cursor will land on the first element requiring input. Upon entering the label value, press the tab to go to the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; property. You can choose to use the variable reference as is or update it to match the variable name in your JavaScript file. Reaching the variant property, two options will be presented as a drop-down menu, allowing you to pick either of the two valid options.

/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I create my own?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! Code Snippets are a great resource for project teams who build custom components or leverage repetitive code throughout their application and want to make it easy for team members to implement patterns. Some quick examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commented file headers to include your company name, license, etc.; in fact, Salesforce includes such a snippet in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/blob/develop/.vscode/snippets.code-snippets"&gt;VS Code Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the correct copyright notices are included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom LWC component implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API call constructors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated test scaffolding; just having the curly braces and parents filled out is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects can create their own sets of snippets by creating a &lt;code&gt;snippets.code-snippets&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;.vscode/&lt;/code&gt; directory of their project. Since it is a part of the project’s repository, all team members will benefit from updates throughout the dev lifecycle. This allows teams to make opinionated decisions about the structure of code and how it is implemented. If components have a lot of properties or implementation patterns, multiple versions of a code snippet can be created to accommodate different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing to VS Code Extension Snippets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode"&gt;Salesforce Extensions for VS Code&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source project and is open to external contributions. Be sure to follow the repo’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;contributing instructions&lt;/a&gt; which specify how to set up your environment, structure your commits, and sign a Contributor’s License Agreement. To test your updates, save changes locally, open &lt;b&gt;Run&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Debug&lt;/b&gt; from the sidebar, select &lt;b&gt;Launch Extension&lt;/b&gt;, and click &lt;b&gt;Play&lt;/b&gt;. This will compile the extension and open a new VS Code window, allowing you to test updates. Once confirmed, commit your changes and submit a Pull Request!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting LWC Code Snippets can be a boon for developers by helping them produce error-free code in a timely fashion. What’s more, teams can build code snippets to meet project needs and spread best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further resources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>**关键词**：用户反馈，开发流程，用户价值，自动化分类，交互式仪表盘

**大纲**：
- 用户反馈在Mercari应用的开发流程中的重要性
- Mercari如何整合用户反馈并改进开发流程
- Hack Fest项目：使用机器学习自动分类用户反馈
- 通过交互式仪表盘改进周度反馈报告
- 未来的改进和合作机会

**总结**：
本文介绍了Mercari如何将用户反馈整合到应用的开发流程中，以增加用户价值和改进应用。他们通过分析和提取用户评论，使用机器学习自动化分类，建立了一个能够有效处理大量用户反馈的系统。之后，他们通过创建交互式仪表盘，使不同团队可以方便地访问和分析用户反馈，进一步改进了开发流程。文章还提到了未来的改进方向，包括更高效的沟通、更多数据整合以及与其他团队的合作。总之，Mercari积极利用用户反馈来提高应用的质量和用户体验，并不断改进流程以提供更多价值给用户。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, a vast amount of users open the App Store or the Google Play Store to leave ratings and reviews about the Mercari application. They generously provide insights into what they like and dislike, what they find valuable, and what they do not. At Mercari, our mission is to &amp;quot;circulate all forms of value to unleash the potential in all people.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User feedback in the form of app reviews is an invaluable connection between our customers and us. Incorporating this feedback into our development process allows us to unleash the full potential of our application and make it even more valuable to our users, which truly resonates with our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of users access our application daily, and chances are, you are one of them! Our users employ a wide range of devices, operating systems, and varying conditions when utilizing the Mercari mobile application (other open apps, available RAM memory, battery saving mode, phone configuration options, and many others). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducting comprehensive testing under all these circumstances is realistically impossible. While we can leverage the power of logs to understand user behavior and identify crashes, user feedback in the form of reviews provides a more profound insight. These reviews tell the stories of people who use and experience our application, sometimes sharing their positive experiences, and at times, encountering difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As QA Engineers and Managers, anything related to user value is of great interest to us. After all, quality can be defined as &amp;quot;Value to Some Person.&amp;quot; In many cases, our users personify that definition. This is why, as a QA team, we have taken the initiative to integrate user feedback into our development process. Guided by the culture at Mercari, we have collaborated with various teams in order to build a process where everyone can harness the immense treasure trove that lies within Mercari&amp;#8217;s application user reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is a process where we leverage ML to analyze, week by week, all reviews given to our app in the Google Play Store and App Store. The summarization and extraction of information improved cross functional communication between our teams, with the combined goals of addressing issues and considering improvements reported by our users, as well as constantly learning what is in the mind of our users and what they value of our products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One recent instance where user feedback took a protagonistic role on our software development process was on the run up to the launch of Mercari&amp;#8217;s new application in 2022, code-named GU, short for &amp;quot;Ground Up&amp;quot;. GU was more than just an update; it was a complete overhaul of the application. If you&amp;#8217;re curious about the whole experience, be sure to check out our article below on the GU application development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related article (&lt;a href="https://mercan.mercari.com/en/articles/35887/"&gt;https://mercan.mercari.com/en/articles/35887/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the importance of involving our users in the development process, we knew that the success of the new app launch hinged on their collaboration. With a diverse range of devices, operating systems, configurations, and conditions, our users offered invaluable perspectives that we couldn&amp;#8217;t simulate in-house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate this communication, we launched volunteer-based beta programs on the App Store and Google Play Store, giving iOS and Android users the opportunity to try out the new application as soon as we had the new version of the app to a certain level of maturity. Users could share their feedback through a dedicated in-app feedback form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened next exceeded our expectations. We were overwhelmed with the sheer volume of feedback from our users, presenting us with the challenge of sorting and categorizing the data into actionable information for our teams. Our software engineers were busy typing away at their keyboards, focusing on delivering our new version as fast as they could, making it impossible to invest in building an automated system to analyze user feedback. Instead, we had no choice but to tackle this task manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a joint effort between our Voice of Customer (VoC) and QA Engineering teams, analyzing the feedback proved to be a complex task. We faced challenges such as identifying duplicate feedback, language barriers, effectively communicating the feedback to the right teams, and keeping up with the daily influx of feedback. It consumed a significant amount of our time. However, our efforts paid off. Not only did we uncover a fair share of hard to reproduce issues on the app, but we were also able to prioritize our tasks based on the quantity of reports received from users on specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s no exaggeration to say that the success of the app launch was partly attributed to the incredible Mercari users who generously shared their feedback. We were able to address problems, compatibility glitches with other apps, crashes, and even gather improvement suggestions. By taking their feedback into account, we avoided the chaos of encountering all of these issues on launch day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine the turmoil that would have ensued if all users experienced these problems simultaneously! Thanks to the continuous iterative approach of listening to feedback and making necessary improvements, we seamlessly transitioned users into the new GU app. At a company level, we learned a valuable lesson about the immeasurable value of user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hack Fest Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successfully launching the GU program and wrapping up Beta testing, I felt something was off with this user feedback channel shutting down. Though analyzing it was time-consuming, it provided valuable insight to our team. Instead of focusing less on this, I wondered if we could process more feedback with a more streamlined approach. To scale effectively, we needed to automate feedback categorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Initial slide of the presentation of our Hack Fest project: Feedback Classification (should have gone with a fancier name)" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prd-engineering-asset/2023/10/bcdc8c2d-voc_qa_process_hack_fest.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Initial slide of the presentation of our Hack Fest project: Feedback Classification (should have gone with a fancier name)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain traction on this notion, I pitched the idea on the ML Engineering Slack channel. Much to my delight, some colleagues showed keen interest, and one ML engineer named Paul Willot went further by becoming committed to making this a reality. Concurrently, I also discussed potential data sources with our Customer Support team and found support there as well, with Kazue Kudo san from their team deciding to champion things from the VoC side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to our bi-annual &lt;a href="https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230621-e066032084/" title="Hack Fest event"&gt;Hack Fest event&lt;/a&gt;, a 3-day coding marathon open to all employees, we began shaping the framework of our project. With other new members, who jumped on board at the last minute, our objective was to build a minimum viable product (MVP) – an API that could autonomously categorize user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial step was to determine suitable categories for feedback. A balance between broad and overly detailed categories would need to be struck. We eventually settled on eight categories, after initially considering more than ten and doing fine tuning over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was the challenge of training our model. The estimate was that we would need approximately 100 reviews per category to showcase the model&amp;#8217;s effectiveness. Combining our efforts, we managed to manually classify sufficient reviews across all categories, hopefully for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Hack Fest was drawing to a close, our ML engineer readied the model and prepared a proof of concept (PoC) site. Despite time constraints, we presented the working model and its potential benefits to our processes. Our project was well-received, even bagging a &lt;a href="https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230621-e066032084/" title="Special Mention"&gt;Special Mention&lt;/a&gt; from one of the judges (Maekawa Miho-san). However, we realized that this success marked merely the beginning of a greater journey towards fully implementing user feedback into our software development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested about Hack Fest and Mercari Culture, check out this related article: &lt;a href="https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230410-b286fe9577/"&gt;https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230410-b286fe9577/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prd-engineering-asset/2023/10/51e20ea3-voc_qa_process_post.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Template of the reports shared in Slack. This one breaks down the feedback in different categories for teams to work on. Monthly, we would share some graphs as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following months, our model filtered user feedback related to bugs or improvements, assisting in compiling weekly reports. This helped us to quickly evaluate weekly feedback by diving into the reviews that were classified as the categories we cared about the most. We picked out the topics most mentioned by our users and prioritized investigations on them. We also helped prioritize existing tickets with this information. Additionally, we collected improvements laid out by our users to enhance the capabilities of our apps. User input became an essential part of our development process, helping us detect issues and fine-tune features. While we acknowledged the potential to do more with this invaluable tool, we also identified some limitations and areas for future improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Real&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the positive response we received from our weekly reports, there were evident gaps in our process. But, in the spirit of innovation and continuous improvement, we recognized this as an opportunity to refine our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key issue was that stakeholders had limited access to the raw reviews. To address their queries, we had to manually sift through the reports, an exercise that was far from efficient. Similarly, recurrent albeit less common feedback often got overlooked due to its sparse occurrence in our weekly reports. Moreover, our process lacked instant, visually appealing data presentations like graphs, timelines or charts to help quickly comprehend the story behind numbers. Lastly, our not yet mature process had a tendency of duplicating data unnecessarily, a clear area for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen to tackle these pain points, we decided to revolutionize our weekly feedback reports. Our vision was to create an interactive dashboard that allowed stakeholders to access, filter, search, and analyze user feedback data as per their needs. We believed this would help unleash not just the potential of user data but also our team&amp;#8217;s innovative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began the transformation by defining the specifications for the new dashboard. To ensure its efficiency, we created mock data sets for testing and refinement. The upgraded dashboard would now enable users to filter reviews by dates, ratings, categorization, and relevance tags. Realizing the importance of seamless communication, we even integrated a feature for conducting keyword searches in both English and Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping data duplication in check was our next goal. Following several productive discussions, we worked in cohesion with the VoC team and QA to co-own the user reviews data. This allowed us to modify the data without creating redundancies. We also added a &amp;quot;Feature&amp;quot; column as suggested by the VoC team, to clearly highlight which application functionality the feedback pertained to. As part of this journey, we automated some processes previously handled by the VoC team, in collaboration with QA. This teamwork was a testament to Mercari’s collaborative culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prd-engineering-asset/2023/10/e78ad3c0-voc_qa_process_dashboard.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sneak peek of the dashboard we have in place, showing the filtering options available and some basic graphs. Below there’s much more information, insights on ratings trend, preview of the reviews, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the refined data at our disposal, we integrated it with the dashboard, refining as necessary. We were thrilled to roll out our revised weekly reports complete with interactive dashboards. The overwhelming response from Product Development Teams, all roles included, was delightful to witness. Now, our teams could effectively filter and search for keywords related to new features, shedding light on invaluable insights. Empowering our team with this data seemed like a game-changing move and we’re already excited to witness its far-reaching impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvements for the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we glance into the future, we see rooms for optimization and sophistication, even though we have significantly progressed from the days of manually classifying piles of user feedback. The quest for improvement never stops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to augment our efforts in communication can&amp;#8217;t be denied. Engaging as our internal product feedback channel might be, we also acknowledge that we haven&amp;#8217;t roped everyone into it. The key lies in promoting our dashboards and making them more accessible, so that the wealth of insights within can benefit a wider audience. Moreover, a system to ensure that the highlights from our weekly report digests reach the teams who can act upon them directly, is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of opportunities, our sights are set on pouring more data into our ML model pipeline. We strongly believe there is power in volume. By automating more, we can efficiently review additional feedback and take action instead of being bogged down by manual tasks. One promising proposal is to bring back the in-app feedback form. While another involves widening our range to cover feedback from other platforms like SNS. Indeed, our current model may need some fine-tuning for these new data sources, but the potential wealth of unique insights is an exciting prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an alliance with the Customer Support (CS) team feels like a natural progression. CS creates investigations for repeated inquiries about the application behavior, and we do something quite similar for repeated user reviews of our app. We believe a collaboration may pave the way for a unified process or cross-utility of our data sets to boost the quality of the solutions we&amp;#8217;re able to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this journey of continuously refining our approach to harnessing user feedback stands as a testament to our unwavering commitment to quality at Mercari. The narrative underscores the profound impact of collaboration between different teams within the company, as well as the potential for continuous improvement in our delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the initial struggle with overwhelming feedback, the manual categorization of data, to the development of an automated system through our Hack Fest project, we&amp;#8217;ve come a long way in understanding and integrating user feedback. The creation of an interactive dashboard has positively revolutionized our weekly feedback reports, enabling the different teams to efficiently use and discern data. Furthermore, the role the VoC and QA teams played in refining our use of data underscores the richness of diverse collaborations within Mercari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we recognize that our journey is far from over. There remain opportunities for more efficient communication, further data integration, and exploration of fruitful alliances with more teams within the company. As we continue evolving and embracing these opportunities, our aim remains clear: to deliver ever-greater value to the users of our application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing our unique experiences, we hope to spark dialogue and collaboration beyond Mercari&amp;#8217;s walls. The strength of user feedback should never be underestimated. When harnessed effectively, it has the power to transform services, enhance user experience, and prompt targeted enhancements that truly resonate with user needs. As such, it is an invaluable resource in our mission to &amp;quot;circulate all forms of value to unleash the potential in all people”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Joy at Work: How Galwegians Chart Their Professional Destinies</title>
      <link>https://galois.com/blog/2023/10/joy-at-work-how-galwegians-chart-their-professional-destinies/</link>
      <description>**关键词**: Galois，求职，“joy at work”，自我导向，职业发展 

**大纲**:
- “Joy at Work”的核心原则：工作应该是一种深度满足和有意义的来源，我们可以自由地将我们的技能和才能提供给Galois，为Galois和自己共同获益。
- Galois如何促进“joy at work”：允许员工根据自己的兴趣和喜好灵活地指导自己的职业发展，鼓励员工在公司内部转岗发展。
- 根据员工的技能和兴趣与公司的需求进行职业转型。
- 作者的个人经历：从兼职顾问到高级财务分析师的职业发展，展示了自我导向职业发展的案例。
- Galois的核心信念：个人的快乐和专业的成功并不是互斥的，而是相互交织的因素，对于一个有意义的工作经验至关重要。

**总结**:
本文介绍了Galois公司追求“joy at work”的核心原则和实践方法，鼓励员工在工作中追求个人的满足和快乐，并允许他们根据自己的兴趣和能力来自我导向地发展职业。通过作者的个人经历，展示了如何在Galois内部实现职业转型和发展。Galois坚信个人的快乐和专业的成功是相辅相成的，为员工提供了一个充满意义和成就感的工作环境。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of Galois’s core principles is “Seek joy at work.” While that may sound a little fuzzy, we define this principle as follows: “Work should be a source of deep satisfaction and meaning, a place where we can freely offer our skills and talents to the mutual benefit of Galois and ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest ways Galois fosters “joy at work” involves giving Galwegians the ability to chart their own professional destiny—flexibly steering the direction of their career based on their interests and the kinds of tasks that give them joy. Machine learning specialists have learned formal methods and changed the kind of work they do; Research Engineers have discovered a love for project management and become Project Leads; even our General Counsel started out as the front desk manager! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this sort of career transition isn’t done on a whim. To change tacks, a Galwegian’s skills and interests have to match up with an unmet need within the company. But within those parameters, Galois builds from our “joy at work” principle to allow for a remarkable amount of self-direction when it comes to growing and evolving one’s career.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My own story is a great example of what this can look like in action. Over my 15 years at Galois, I went from a part-time consultant to senior financial analyst.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My journey looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where I started:&lt;/strong&gt; Independent Consultant&lt;strong&gt; →&lt;/strong&gt; Part-Time Employee&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, Galois hired me as an independent consultant. Within a year, their contracts department realized they needed help. I had the skill sets they needed and the desire to do the work, so I was hired on as a part-time employee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution round 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Part-Time → Full-Time&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back then, the company was still relatively small, with about a quarter of the employees we have now. Still, there were a lot of operational hats to wear without enough heads to wear them. Since I was already working at Galois part-time, and had already built trust and relationships, it was an easy transition for me to put on a few of those hats that suited me: general office management, continued contracts support, assistance with proposals and costing efforts, and lightweight accounting support. As duties were added, I transitioned from part-time Contract Specialist to full-time Office Coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution round 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Office Coordinator → Offer Building / Proposals Operations&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the company grew, so did the needs in our offer building (the term we use for sales) group, specifically around proposals and forecasting. Since I was already working in and enjoying these tasks as a sub-set of my job, I decided to pursue Proposals Operations as my full time work. This is where I spent the bulk of my years at Galois, working alongside an amazing team of business development experts, principal scientists, and researchers, and having a blast doing it!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution round 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Offer Building / Proposals Operations → Financial Analyst&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After spending a few years in the offer building arena, with the added support for engineering and finance, I’d been exposed to a wide range of overall company operations. It felt like a good time for me to make a shift, and a need was emerging in finance to have a dedicated financial analyst, which perfectly aligned with my career goals. Another win/win!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, my career evolved with my interests and Galois’s needs. When I wanted to try a new and interesting career direction, I didn’t have to leave Galois to do it. I looked for opportunities where my skills and “joy at work” intersected with Galois’s needs, and—over and over again—Galois supported my changing roles to fit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It all comes back to our core belief that personal joy and professional success are not mutually exclusive, but rather intertwined factors that contribute to a fulfilling work experience. For me, those beliefs empowered my career progression, turning “Joy at Work” from an abstract idea into a lived experience that has profoundly shaped my professional journey at Galois.&lt;/p&gt;

  - light-dark函数需要与color-scheme属性一起使用

- 浏览器支持情况
  - 目前Firefox 120支持light-dark函数
  - 预计其他浏览器也将很快支持

**总结：**

该文章介绍了在Web上切换浅色和深色主题的几种方式。可以使用JavaScript或prefers-color-scheme媒体查询根据用户系统偏好切换主题。另外，CSS引入了新的light-dark函数，可以更方便地实现无缝切换，并且可以根据不同属性指定不同的属性值。此外，color-scheme属性可以扩展light-dark函数的使用范围。目前，light-dark函数在Firefox 120中得到支持，希望其他浏览器也会很快支持该功能。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have many ways to switch between light and dark themes on the web. We can use JavaScript to switch between themes or we can use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; media query in CSS to switch between themes based on the user’s system preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="markdown-toc"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/the-new-light-dark-function-to-switch-theme-color-in-css/#the-new-light-dark-function" id="markdown-toc-the-new-light-dark-function"&gt;The new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/the-new-light-dark-function-to-switch-theme-color-in-css/#browser-support" id="markdown-toc-browser-support"&gt;Browser support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; media query lets us do things that would only be applied when light or dark mode is enabled on the user’s system. For instance, you can change the background color of the page to black when the user has enabled dark mode on their system like so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also change the color of the text based on the user’s system preference the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-new-light-dark-function"&gt;The new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to make this all more seamless, CSS is getting &lt;a href="https://www.bram.us/2023/10/09/the-future-of-css-easy-light-dark-mode-color-switching-with-light-dark/"&gt;a new function called&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; which will let you specify two values for a property. The first value will be applied when the user has enabled light mode on their system and the second value will be applied when the user has enabled dark mode on their system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, we don’t need to use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; media query anymore. The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function will take care of that for us. And it’s also more granular as you can specify different values for different properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the user’s theme preference, the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function can also be used to switch between two values based on the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme"&gt;CSS property&lt;/a&gt; allows an element to indicate which color schemes it can comfortably be rendered in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means, for &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; to work, you must also include a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;--text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* In Light Mode = return 1st value. 
  In Dark Mode = return 2nd value. */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; property on a specific element so that it only applies to that element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="browser-support"&gt;Browser support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for browser support, the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function is currently supported in Firefox 120 but hopefully, it will be supported in other browsers soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function on its specification page &lt;a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#light-dark"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New short story: “Professional Integrity”</title>
      <link>https://blog.rinesi.com/2023/10/new-short-story-professional-integrity/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of your coworkers seem to look forward to the mandatory therapy sessions. You wonder what they talk about with the AI therapist, most often as your session approaches and you have to decide what parts of the truth you&amp;#8217;ll let yourself talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can talk about anything you want. Interactions in a therapy context aren&amp;#8217;t available to your managers and are only used in an anonymized way to monitor the overall health of the company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s only a program. You could ask it if it feels embarrassed for saying something as ridiculous as &amp;#8220;in an anonymized way&amp;#8221;, but it&amp;#8217;d only use that as another input in its modeling. It&amp;#8217;s as incapable of feeling that type of shame as your car software or somebody in marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, you are fairly sure the company and the implant&amp;#8217;s maker lie about the device in your brain not working as a lie detector and the implant happens to be the main thing you don&amp;#8217;t want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&amp;#8217;d feel better if you hadn&amp;#8217;t done therapy before entering the company. You have to, now  &amp;mdash; an FDA requirement for anybody with a cognitively interfaced brain implant &amp;mdash; and restricted to the company&amp;#8217;s own AI &amp;mdash; too many secrets in your head, operational and otherwise; some of them you even know yourself. A good therapy AI, goes the theory, would be able to glean aspects of the implant&amp;#8217;s software based on your response patterns as easily as it can model the rest of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As easily as it can model &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt; Easy mistake to make even in the privacy of your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s private. Your contract says so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You seem anxious lately. What&amp;#8217;s on your mind?&lt;/i&gt; (You want to laugh at the phrasing, don&amp;#8217;t, think the implant registered the intent anyway and informed the AI.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Actaeon deadlines, mostly. It&amp;#8217;s an important project and I know how much it matters to the company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image of a man rendered on your screen nods. &lt;i&gt;Sleep problems aren&amp;#8217;t uncommon in this sort of situation. Have you been sleeping well?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist knows to the minute how much you&amp;#8217;ve been sleeping and when. Better than you know, unless you really haven&amp;#8217;t slept more than an hour or two a day for the last few months. You wouldn&amp;#8217;t put it past the implant&amp;#8217;s capabilities to keep you functional in that situation if not for the fact that if they could do that then it&amp;#8217;d be everybody&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reply that you think you&amp;#8217;ve been sleeping the usual four hours. You used to need six before the implant. Another thing you both know and neither one says aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image nods again and the session ends soon afterward. You are happy to go back to work. You aren&amp;#8217;t always. &lt;i&gt;Motivated,&lt;/i&gt; yes. You haven&amp;#8217;t had once to push yourself to start working ever since you entered the company and got the implant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the company and the implant and everything else you had already done mandatory (read: your father told you to) therapy with a designated therapist (read: the one your father chose and paid for) to address what she ended up describing as episodes of loss of emotional control stemming from environmental stress. &amp;#8220;Environmental stress&amp;#8221; was an euphemism and loss of emotional control was something you were already familiar with &amp;ndash; but until then you had never thought about what it was that you were failing to control. It turned out that minds could have desires they themselves didn&amp;#8217;t know about. It wasn&amp;#8217;t a moral failure but a fact of neural architecture. Everybody had a subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist didn&amp;#8217;t think dreams were a good window into the subconscious. &lt;i&gt;You are who you are in everything you do. Don&amp;#8217;t worry about decrypting your dreams. Look at what you do. What things are you doing you don&amp;#8217;t know you are doing?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stopped working with her a few years before entering the company. If you could, you would tell her that your dreams have changed since you got the implant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t get a brain scan except in a company-approved clinic. The implant connects to a separate wireless network inside the office and enters a pseudo-Faraday cage mode when you leave. Those aren&amp;#8217;t the only safety measures: the Security department considers external infiltration a serious issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There&amp;#8217;s still a tiny scar on the back of your head where they inserted the implant&amp;#8217;s main mesh and left a small access panel for the annual hardware upgrades.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security hasn&amp;#8217;t forbidden trying to learn about the implant by introspection and self-observation, as if it were a compulsion or trauma. It probably means it&amp;#8217;s useless. You try anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everybody else they hire, you were very good before entering the company and much better afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have more focus. Less of a social life, not that you really had one. You no longer stress about the societal negative externalities of your work. No nightmares about dead children. A great salary. The indescribable feeling of being so good at what you do you don&amp;#8217;t remember the last time you made a mistake or stood still confused about the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI never asks you if you think about quitting. It&amp;#8217;s not that they don&amp;#8217;t want to put the idea in your head. They know you won&amp;#8217;t. You know you won&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s not even the implant,&lt;/i&gt; you think sometimes. The thought makes you feel ill in a different way, but at least you&amp;#8217;re almost sure it&amp;#8217;s yours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CodeSOD: Write, Write Again</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/write-write-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melissa&lt;/strong&gt; was trying to figure out why an old application wasn't writing out a data file when commanded to do so. It was an implemented feature, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work, it &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; worked at one point- but it wasn't working now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She traced through the C code and found this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-c"&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="hljs-title function_"&gt;writeconf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-params"&gt;(&lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
{
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; fd;
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; buf[&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;];
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; len;
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; loop;

    &lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;snprintf&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;amp;buf[&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;(buf),&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"%d\n"&lt;/span&gt;, confval);
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(loop=&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; loop&amp;lt;&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;; loop++)    &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;//try 10 times to open file&lt;/span&gt;
    {
        fd=open(&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"/tmp/conf"&lt;/span&gt;, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT);
        &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(fd != &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;)
        {
            len=write(fd, &amp;amp;buf[&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;strlen&lt;/span&gt;(buf));
            close(fd);
            &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;  &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;//Ok, ready to exit&lt;/span&gt;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this code is to write a single integer out to &lt;code&gt;/tmp/conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first, we use &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; to write that integer out to a buffer. This line alone piles on the WTFs. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;buf[0]&lt;/code&gt; isn't &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, but it's &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. Arrays in C are pointers to the first object in the array. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;buf[0]&lt;/code&gt; returns a pointer to the first object in the array. &lt;em&gt;They're the same thing&lt;/em&gt;. I don't understand why they went the long way around, unless they didn't understand what arrays are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; doesn't need to be 100 characters long, but that's a minor thing. But the real "yikes" is &lt;code&gt;confval&lt;/code&gt; itself- a global variable accessed from inside this function, which hints at many, many other bad choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we loop. We try to open the file up to ten times. If we fail, we just try again. No waiting, no timeouts, just.. try it ten times, as quick as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we open it, we write the data, again using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;buf[0]&lt;/code&gt; idiom. And… do nothing to check that we successfully wrote anything out. We just hope for the best, close the file descriptor, and exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn't answer &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the file wasn't getting written, but it definitely explained why no one was seeing errors. This doesn't do any meaningful error handling. If it can't open the file, it just gives up after ten tries. If it can't write to the file, it doesn't notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: Seriously though, is there some good reason for `&amp;buf[0]` that I don't know about? It seems so intentional, but it makes no sense, and yes, I double checked the spec to make sure there wasn't a gotcha in there that I wasn't thinking about (but only skimmed the section on the subscripting rules, so maybe there's something else out there? MAKE IT MAKE SENSE) --&gt;

**总结：**
Hostinger提供的AI技术驱动的网站构建工具能够根据简短描述自动生成独特的网站，用户只需点击几下即可完成整个过程。新的AI引擎确保每个网站都是独一无二的，并且提供更多样化的布局选择和更完整的页面内容。此外，Hostinger还提供其他AI工具，如AI Writer、AI Heatmap和AI Logo Maker，以帮助用户轻松实现网站开发。使用Hostinger网站构建工具，用户不需要编码或网页设计技能，而且还可以享受免费域名、电子邮件等特点，以确保在线业务的安全性和性能。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;You only need a name, a website type, and a short description to get a website with&lt;strong&gt; AI-powered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/website-builder" rel="follow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hostinger Website Builder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent update ensures that every website AI generates is unique and that the design and content fit the nature of the site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The website creation process remains the same and takes only four clicks. After choosing the &lt;strong&gt;AI Website Builder&lt;/strong&gt;, you just need to describe your business or project.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Website creation with AI Website Builder" class="wp-image-5649" height="613" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/websitebuilder-aibuilder-1024x613.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The AI will automatically prepare the page structure, layout, and mobile view. Then, it will generate your unique content, choose relevant pictures, and perform other technical tasks. While this might sound complicated, &lt;strong&gt;your unique website will be ready in less than a minute&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are unhappy with it, return to the AI form by clicking the corresponding button on the page&amp;#8217;s top-left corner. Refine your request, or don’t even change anything – the newly generated site will still differ from the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Websites generated with Hostinger AI Website Builder." class="wp-image-5650" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/aiwebsitebuilder-generated-websites-1024x683.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once satisfied with the result, personalize the site to your liking. Enter the Full edit mode for complete customization. &lt;strong&gt;Change colors and fonts, drag and drop page elements, add, remove, or switch sections, and make other adjustments&lt;/strong&gt; to get the website you want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-advantages-of-the-new-ai-engine"&gt;Advantages of the New AI Engine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our earlier AI integration used several predefined templates and added relevant content to them. In some cases, websites were very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new AI engine generates a sitemap of website pages and their sections. It then injects a suitable variation for each of the sections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;AI uses the same framework to create a new, unique website&lt;/strong&gt; for every request it gets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This way, every blog, online portfolio, or business showcase generated by AI differs. The advantages are threefold:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger variety of site layouts&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re also working on more design options to expand the choice even further.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The same website type can cover more use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; With a Business showcase type, a restaurant website can now have a separate menu section, and a personal coach site can include an appointment section.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Websites are much more complete. &lt;/strong&gt;The relevant pages are generated based on the initial description, and additional ones can be added anytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-ai-tools-in-hostinger-website-builder"&gt;More AI Tools in Hostinger Website Builder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI builder is one of several &lt;strong&gt;AI tools&lt;/strong&gt; in Hostinger Website Builder. Here’s how AI can make web development easier and more efficient:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Writer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Describe your idea, and get unique, compelling, and SEO-friendly content. It can generate any kind of content, including blog posts, pages, or even product descriptions, to boost your SEO performance and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Heatmap&lt;/strong&gt;. Analyze your website’s design and structure to predict user behavior. By using the heatmap, you can adjust the layout, font sizes, images, buttons, and other design elements so that visitors notice exactly what you want to show them first.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Logo Maker&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Upscale your visual identity with a captivating logo. Share your brand name and slogan, describe your ideal logo, and choose a design from the AI-generated options. Just a few clicks, and you can start using your new logo everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-hostinger-website-builder-benefits"&gt;Other Hostinger Website Builder Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best part of using Hostinger Website Builder is that you &lt;strong&gt;don’t need coding or web design skills&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone can create a website, including a business site, a portfolio, or an online store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell online&lt;/strong&gt; without additional transaction fees and optimize campaigns with &lt;strong&gt;integrated marketing tools&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Create and edit websites with your smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s all included.

      <description>**关键词：**
1. 聊天GPT（ChatGPT）
2. Copilot
3. Codex
4. LLM工具
5. 技术面试

**大纲：**
- 聊天GPT、Copilot和Codex等工具的介绍和应用。
- 使用这些工具进行实时编码面试的影响和挑战。
- 在技术面试中评估使用这些工具的候选人的方法和问题。
- 没有解决面试中使用工具的问题对候选人和公司带来的影响。
- 未来的技术面试趋势和对面试过程的改进。

**总结：**
本文讨论了在聊天GPT、Copilot、Codex等工具的流行和广泛应用下，如何在技术面试中评估候选人使用这些工具的能力。未解决这个问题可能导致无法评估候选人的真正能力，从而影响招聘的质量。文章提出了评估使用这些工具的候选人的方法，并展望了未来技术面试的发展趋势。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FcHc33-5Mg3PjxFoxtOtsw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image generated by using the title of this article&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of ChatGPT, Copilot, Codex, and other tools makes it easier to code but also makes it easier to answer live coding interviews unless we do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OLX, we promote the use of a tool called &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110901049833439234?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7110901049833439234%29"&gt;PlusOne&lt;/a&gt;, which is an internal LLM tool made to help us code, coach ourselves, and more. This reveals an interesting gap, which is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If OLX promotes the use of a tool once you are hired, why when hiring are we not evaluating people based on using these tools effectively?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of not addressing this is that people who can’t adapt to the use of these tools will surely lag behind other engineers, and their performance will suffer. We will only be able to notice this after a few months, and it is better to notice that as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those who are not aware: ChatGPT is a Large Language Model able to generate code if you give it a problem statement and the platform+language it should use. Copilot is a tool from Github that can autocomplete large amounts of code, e.g. writing unit tests. Codex is a similar LLM tool from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we saw two interview candidates using Copilot/Codex during a live coding interview. While we talked about the possibility of that happening during our interviewer's sync, we were not really prepared to evaluate candidates if they use those, compared to candidates who don’t use them. Because of this, I was interested to know the latest on the:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allowing the usage of Copilot/LLMs during live coding interviews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case of allowing it, evaluating candidates that use them during the interview&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the case of not allowing it, evaluating if they know how to use these tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will be exploring what happens if we don’t act on this, what can be done to adjust to the new normal, and what is the view of the future in tech interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Related Work&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other articles discussed this topic. This &lt;a href="https://blog.expertlead.com/how-ai-driven-chatbots-like-chatgpt-are-affecting-the-way-of-doing-tech-assessments"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; talks about the critical thinking and creativity skills that cannot be taken away by the AI tools that are provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dawn-ai-coding-rethinking-engineering-interview-vidal-graupera/"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; article, Vidal talks about how soft skills become more important in the light of these tools that help with generating code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pair+programming+with+llm&amp;amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enDE996DE996&amp;amp;oq=pair+programming+with+llm&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgcIAhAAGKIE0gEIMzU0OWowajSoAgCwAgA&amp;amp;hl=en-GB&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; on how to pair program with a LLM was published in collaboration with Google. This shows some basics of how to use a LLM while writing code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not addressing what to do on this topic will lead to a couple of scenarios&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Candidates will not be able to show their full potential during interviews when we don’t allow them to use the Copilot that they are used to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will get candidates who we are not sure if they can’t learn to work with these tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We get less time evaluating their critical thinking skills due to setting up code, downloading dependencies, or a slow machine, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will not be able to find candidates who work very well with these tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These all impact the quality of hires by decreasing success rates for people who cannot use LLM tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of not allowing these tools. We are going to be falling back into the age of interviews before these tools existed. People rely on their own problem-solving skills, and the amount of output they generate during live coding interviews is limited by their machine’s speed in compilation and their ability to debug quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case we allow the copilot tools, there would be less effort in generating the initial code to allow developers to start quickly. There are multiple cases that could happen based on how good the Copilot/LLM tools they use are, in decreasing order of help from the Copilot/LLM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They don’t have access to these tools. In this case, we fall back to classical interviewing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Copilot generates the whole solution for them, with no need to edit/debug, and it already covers the edge cases we would be throwing at them. We would only be able to evaluate their prompt engineering skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Copilot generates code that works for the normal cases and is missing edge cases. We would be able to evaluate their prompt engineering skills, their code review skills, their ability to identify edge cases, and their ability to adapt the code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Copilot generates a barely working code that doesn’t meet the requirements. They would have to correct the LLM to guide it to a working solution like the case above. Or they would have to break down the problem so that the tool can help them with some parts of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cases reveal some of the (new) key concepts that we need to pay attention to when evaluating candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting of technical coding interview from pure code generation to prompt engineering plus code review plus refactoring (of course, also debugging and testing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. they would write the problem in a form that LLM understands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Review&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. to find edge cases and see if the code works as intended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. changing the architecture of the generated code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. if the generated code doesn’t work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. to confirm that the generated code works in various cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to assess the seniority of the person using these key concepts, we also have to benchmark what a junior vs mid vs senior interviewee would look like. For example, a Senior Engineer would be able to identify more edge cases or would be able to explain the engineering choices that the tool made and maybe explain what happens to these decisions if the assumptions change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View of the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Coding interviews are a way to test how someone would perform in a real-life situation in a short amount of time using a controlled environment. Some tradeoffs in this process are the amount of time and the accuracy and granularity of evaluation that we are able to make during this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by a &lt;a href="https://www.offerzen.com/events/offerzen-events/untold-stories-in-tech-hiring/do-more-with-less-futureproof-technical-assessments-with-ai"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; I heard before that mentions that, ideally, we would also include working together with the team to evaluate a real-life situation where people are working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the interview process would involve people from the team and a Copilot-like tool, which mirrors how a normal working day looks like. The problem with this approach is that it uses a lot of time from the interviewers. In the current view of things, we already have this problem of Engineers spending a lot of time on interviews, which is mitigated by limiting the time per week that is allocated to this. We also treat interviewing as part of Senior Engineer responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While using LLMs won’t replace our technical skills, it will definitely add to our suite of second-brain tools like Google Search, Stackoverflow, or our own notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there will still be some time until companies adapt to allowing these tools or being able to evaluate people who use these AI tools during live coding interviews. The call to action is for us to start talking about how to evaluate them. Otherwise, we won’t be able to have people who can’t work with these tools and will be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be diving deeper into this topic and how to transition from the classical technical interview process in another article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=4e09553bb117" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tech.olx.com/live-coding-interviews-in-the-era-of-llms-4e09553bb117"&gt;Live Coding Interviews in the Era of LLMs&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://tech.olx.com"&gt;OLX Engineering&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

**总结：**
本文介绍了在游戏开发中与软件咨询公司建立合作伙伴关系的潜力。通过合作伙伴关系能够加速项目的推进并提供多样化的技能和服务。软件咨询公司不仅能够帮助开发团队加快上市时间，还能通过协作优势提高生产力。他们的技能包括快速开发和部署用户生成内容平台、伴随应用和门户、游戏用户界面和企业设计系统、用户体验设计、人工智能驱动的分析和个性化以及战略化的盈利与用户激励等方面。通过与合适的软件咨询公司合作，可以最大限度地发挥游戏的潜力并取得成功。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a decision-maker on a game development team, you&amp;#8217;re no stranger to the ever-changing dynamics of the gaming industry. Here, time-to-market is not just a catchphrase but a critical metric. The constant demand for new and engaging content means game developers, large and small, often face immense pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve probably engaged with traditional industry partnerships. But, have you ever considered teaming up with a software consultancy as your g&lt;span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"&gt;ame co-development partner? It might be time you did, and here&amp;#8217;s why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case Study: Pixelberry Studios and Atomic Object&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year and a half, I&amp;#8217;ve been immersed in an exciting project, bringing my skills as a software designer to a collaborative effort between Atomic Object and Pixelberry. (&lt;a href="https://atomicobject.com/portfolio/pixelberry-digital-storytelling-platform"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can read more about the project here!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) Pixelberry looked beyond the usual suspects for partners and came to Atomic Object, a software consultancy. Theirs was a large ask — create an immersive User Generated Content Platform from the ground up. We helped them deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our parent company gave us one year and asked us if we could go big,” said David Robinson, Director of Production at StoryLoom. “We asked the Atomic team, ‘We want to go big — can you go on this journey with us?’ and they said, ‘Yeah, we’ll get on that ship with you!’ They didn’t flinch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a dynamic team comprising fellow design and software consultants from Atomic Object and key stakeholders at Pixelberry, we poured our collective knowledge and passion into crafting &lt;a href="https://storyloom.com/"&gt;StoryLoom,&lt;/a&gt; a cross-platform experience for mobile and desktop where the community can play, build, and publish interactive story games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixelberry and Atomic collaborated throughout the g&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ame development pipeline. Using Figma and focusing on value-driven, lean UX, we embarked on designing an enterprise-level design system and applied it to create an end-to-end user experience. From creating a cross-platform architecture to building custom content authoring tools for interactive story publishing, we delivered beyond the role of traditional software development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was completed on time and budget, delivering a feature-rich, engaging platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They are laser-focused on budget and timing, which is something I&amp;#8217;ve never seen in 30 years of development,&amp;#8221; said David Robinson. &amp;#8220;It was delivered on time, on budget, to expectation, live—not three or four milestones late with people leaving and the platform half-baked and full of bugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome included an innovative set of creator tools within the &lt;a href="https://storyloom.com/"&gt;StoryLoom&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem, including a user-friendly, no-code story builder, a dynamic character creator, a creator economy, and a custom admin experience. The most rewarding moment was when we finally reached our goal together and launched an open beta for the storytelling community in just 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience has led me to think more about how software and game companies might team up to produce innovative products. This is not because it&amp;#8217;s my job, but because I have a passion for games and would genuinely love to see more projects in this intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software Consultancies: Empower Your Gaming Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a reason Pixelberry chose to partner with Atomic to create a proof of concept, and eventually ship a cross-platform application for web and mobile. Here are some advantages I believe software companies like Atomic bring to the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#8217;re very versatile!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software consultancy is not just a dev shop. We&amp;#8217;re extensions of your team and bring &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/08/22/generalist-makers-the-unicorns-of-the-software-industry/"&gt;diverse services and experiences&lt;/a&gt; to the table. &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/tag/generalist-makers/"&gt;Generalist makers&lt;/a&gt; have a wide range of skills, from &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/07/18/mobile-phone-statistics/"&gt;product strategy&lt;/a&gt; and UX Design to API integrations and analytics. One of our key strengths is that we bring best practices and lessons learned from other sectors like healthcare and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We can help accelerate your go-to-market strategy.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/08/04/sprint-planning/"&gt;agile methodologies&lt;/a&gt;, consultancies can help streamline your roadmap and processes. From the first idea to beta, and even after the big launch, a high-performing, dedicated team can be essential. They&amp;#8217;ll help you move and scale fast without missing important milestones along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#8217;re pros at collaboration.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software consultants can effortlessly blend into your existing setup. Whether you need them to &lt;a href="https://atomicobject.com/client-resources/select-software-development-partner"&gt;lead or simply supplement your team&lt;/a&gt;, their contribution will level up your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3656846" height="1080" src="https://spin.atomicobject.com/wp-content/uploads/3.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Software Consultancies Offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most software consultancies don&amp;#8217;t specialize in game production for game engines like Unity, our teams share much of the same development skills. We&amp;#8217;re also both versed in designing and engineering services like those that support gameplay and the larger player experience.&lt;br /&gt;
User-Generated Content Platforms &amp;#8211; Skill sets in JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular translate to rapid development and deployment of UGC platforms. This can supercharge co-creation and community engagement, and incentivize players to create value in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companion Apps and Portals&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you envision your game sharing real-time data with a companion app? &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/08/28/server-sent-events/"&gt;Modern APIs and WebSocket technology&lt;/a&gt; can make this a reality. Using these tools, you can offer players a seamless experience, from in-game to secondary screens. Create a more immersive experience by enabling player personalization and customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game UI and Enterprise Design Systems&lt;/strong&gt;. A cohesive design language across platforms is more than eye candy. It’s essential for brand continuity, and this is where software designers excel. Implementing flexible and scalable &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/11/23/figma-reusable-complex-components/"&gt;design systems&lt;/a&gt; encourages a consistent look and feel across complex game ecosystems. Implementing reusable &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/06/22/reusable-react-components/"&gt;components&lt;/a&gt;, modules, and &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/07/19/typescript-federated-modules/"&gt;microfrontends&lt;/a&gt; helps create an easily scalable foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Experience (UX) Design&lt;/strong&gt;. Software designers are adept at crafting user-centric experiences. Leveraging insights from user research and analytics, like methods used in Player Experience (PX) Design, they can help fine-tune in-game interactions to optimize enjoyment, engagement, and retention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Powered Analytics and Personalization&lt;/strong&gt;. Integration of machine learning can elevate your game by introducing features like predictive analytics and personalized player experiences. Software consultants experienced in AI integrations can identify new opportunities for increasing player engagement, player retention, or &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;average revenue per user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Monetization and User Incentives&lt;/strong&gt;. A software consultancy&amp;#8217;s expertise isn&amp;#8217;t limited to development and design. They can also construct secure, transparent in-game economies and strategies to incentivize player engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting a partner to co-develop your game or app is an enduring commitment. And, in a world where game companies are constantly racing against the clock, augmentation through a strategic team partnership can be your game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3656845" height="1080" src="https://spin.atomicobject.com/wp-content/uploads/2-1.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is knowing if you&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="https://atomicobject.com/client-resources/choosing-the-right-software-development-partner"&gt;choosing the right partner&lt;/a&gt;. You don&amp;#8217;t just need more people. Instead, you need the right people who can go beyond traditional roles to deliver results and truly augment your own capabilities. A software consultancy can be your unexplored avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t limit your scope. Consider software consultancies like Atomic Object in your &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/06/17/software-partner-estimations/"&gt;selection process&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#8217;ll get more than just additional hands; you gain strategic partners committed to your game&amp;#8217;s success. Let&amp;#8217;s unlock your game&amp;#8217;s full potential, together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Add Dark Mode in ReactJS Using Material UI</title>
      <link>https://semaphoreci.com/blog/dark-mode-reactjs-material-ui</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Material UI framework is an open-source user interface framework for React that follows the principles of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://m3.material.io/"&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s Material Design&lt;/a&gt;. It offers a variety of components allowing developers to create appealing and user-friendly interfaces, without starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Material Design prioritizes a consistent user interface with attention given to elements like light, shadow, and motion effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make our application more visually appealing we will learn how to code a Dark Mode feature for our application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can combine the Material UI framework with React to create a Dark Mode of our web applications. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of adding Dark Mode to a React application using Material UI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dark Mode, also known as night mode or darkness theme refers to an option in the user interface design where the content, on the screen is presented in colors compared to the illumination mode. When you activate the mode the background color typically appears as black or dark while the text and user interface elements are displayed in colors that create a striking contrast, between the foreground and background.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s now find out how to add Dark mode in React using Material UI (MUI).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-setting-up-a-react-project"&gt;Setting up a React Project&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we need to set up a React project first. Here&amp;#8217;s how you can get started:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-prerequisites"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you have Node.js and npm (node package manager) installed on your system before we start to implement Dark Mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-installation-of-required-dependencies"&gt;Installation of required dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To install Node.js, visit the Node.js&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/current"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, and download the current version of it according to your operating system. After that just follow the installation steps to complete the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the Node.js is installed, check whether the node.js version is properly installed by running the given command in your command line terminal:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;node –version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the Node is installed correctly, we can proceed further to add the dark mode functionality in React using MUI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-creating-a-new-react-project"&gt;Creating a new React project&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We typically create the react app using the traditional method i.e., using Create React App (CRA), but it can take a lot of time to install the required dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vite &amp;#8211; a new frontend tool that saves the time in creating a react application. So, now instead of using CRA, we are going to use Vite:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the following command in your terminal to start working with Vite:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm create vite@latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Follow the prompts to enter your project name, framework, and a variant:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;Need to install the following packages:
  create-vite@4.4.1
Ok to proceed? (y) y

✔ Project name: ... my-react-project
✔ Select a framework: » React
✔ Select a variant: » JavaScript&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, navigate to your project directory using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd my-react-project&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, use the npm command to install the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-configuring-material-ui-in-the-project"&gt;Configuring Material UI in the project&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To integrate Material UI into your React app, you need to install the Material UI core package and its styles. These come in three packages:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-start-the-development-server"&gt;Start the development server&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we will start our development server to test whether everything is properly implemented and is working.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will see the following output:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;VITE v4.4.9  ready in 943 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To see the output, visit &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:5173/&lt;/code&gt; where the default react project is running:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-21888" height="818" src="https://wpblog.semaphoreci.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f48467a316f526b2e706e67.png" width="1011" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-implement-dark-mode-using-material-ui-in-reactjs"&gt;Implement Dark Mode using Material UI in ReactJS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adding the dark mode feature in a React application involves instatiating a ThemeProvider to handle dark and light themes and adding a switch to change between modes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-enabling-dark-mode-using-material-uis-themeprovider-component"&gt;Enabling Dark Mode using Material UI&amp;#8217;s ThemeProvider component&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Material UI provides a theme provider component called ThemeProvider that will allow themes to be defined and used in the app. The ThemeProvider tool allows for a dynamic switch from light to dark themes when implementing the Dark mode. You may create two separate themes when using a Dark mode, one for Light Mode and the other for Dark Mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can use the ThemeProvider service to place components of your application into a package and switch among these themes according to user preferences or special events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To enable the dark mode, we need to create a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;darkTheme&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;createTheme&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;utility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For applying the dark theme to entire application, we will wrap all our main content into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;component, ensuring that all components within it follow the defined theme, creating a consistent and visually appealing user interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now go to the &lt;code&gt;src/App.js&lt;/code&gt; file in your project and replace the existing code of the file with the following example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;// App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";

import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";

export default function App() {

  // create a darkTheme function to handle dark theme using createTheme
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      mode: darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light',
    },
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
	// other code goes here…
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code, apart from using just the ThemeProvider, we also use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;CssBaseline&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to use the full set of Global CSS Styles in your applications. The inclusion of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;CssBaseline&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is required for ensuring coherent image experience in both light as well as darkness modes when implementing this mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once, you are done with the above step, you can now create a separate dark theme with different colors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-creating-a-separate-dark-theme"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a separate dark theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To customize the dark theme for multiple components in the application, you can modify it by defining the primary, and secondary colors and other properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Replace the existing palette colors with the following example code in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;after the imports and before&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;export default function App()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js

export default function App() {

// applying the primary and secondary theme colors
const darkTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: 'dark', //default theme
    primary: {
      main: '#90caf9',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#f48fb1',
    },
   // add other properties here…
  },
});

  ...

  return(
    ...
  )

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the complete&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;setup, your entire app will now use the dark theme by default. But what if we want to toggle between light and dark themes? We will do it next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-toggling-dark-mode"&gt;Toggling Dark Mode&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To give your users a way to toggle between different theme modes, you can add React&amp;#8217;s context to a button&amp;#8217;s onChange event, as shown in the following demo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-creating-a-switch-or-button-to-toggle-between-light-and-dark-mode"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a switch or button to toggle between light and dark mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To toggle between the light and dark modes in a React app, we need to add a switch button to it. Adding a switch can be done by importing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;Component from Material UI and then defining it in the App component.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For defining a switch, we can simply add the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;component between the ThemeProvider tags. We&amp;#8217;re going to add a div, a card with example content and the switch to change the theme:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js 

export default function App() {

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    ...
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;

        //Adding the switch button
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={darkMode} onChange={toggleSwitchFunction} /&gt;
         ...
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you have added the Switch button, let’s define the toggle states so that the switch can toggle the dark or light theme. Below is how we can define the states using the &lt;code&gt;useState()&lt;/code&gt; hook in React.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js 

export default function App() {

  // state to manage the dark mode
  const [toggleDarkMode, setToggleDarkMode] = useState(true);

  // function to toggle the dark mode as true or false
  const toggleDarkTheme = () =&gt; {
    setToggleDarkMode(!toggleDarkMode);
  };

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    ...
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&gt;Toggle Dark mode&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={toggleDarkMode} onChange={toggleDarkTheme} /&gt;
         ...
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we have first imported all the required components from React and MUI, after which inside the main App component, we have initialized a state variable&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;toggleDarkMode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;where the initial value is set to true, indicating the dark theme is currently active. With the variable, we have also defined a function to update the state called&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;setToggleDarkMode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will add our card example to switch the theme and if you have followed all the steps correctly your App.js should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js file

import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";
import { Card, CardContent, CardMedia, Switch, Typography } from "@mui/material"

export default function App() {

  // state to manage the dark mode
  const [toggleDarkMode, setToggleDarkMode] = useState(true);

  // function to toggle the dark mode as true or false
  const toggleDarkTheme = () =&gt; {
    setToggleDarkMode(!toggleDarkMode);
  };

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      mode: 'light',
      primary: {
        main: '#90caf9',
      },
      secondary: {
        main: '#131052',
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&gt;Toggle Dark mode&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={toggleDarkMode} onChange={toggleDarkTheme} /&gt;
        &amp;lt;Card sx={{ width: '30%', borderRadius: 3, padding: 1 }}&gt;
          &amp;lt;CardContent&gt;
            &amp;lt;CardMedia sx={{ height: 180, borderRadius: 3 }} image="https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg" title="semaphore" /&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="h4" component="div" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}&gt;
              Programming Blogs
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }} color="text.secondary"&gt;
              by Semaphore
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="body1"&gt;
              Checkout the latest blogs on Semaphore. Semaphore provides you the best CI/CD solution
              for high-performance engineering teams.
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
          &amp;lt;/CardContent&gt;
        &amp;lt;/Card&gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you run the above code, you will notice that the toggle doesn’t change the theme to dark or light, as we haven’t added the state to update the theme dynamically, it will display a light theme by default.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we will see how we can handle the state of the dark mode toggle and update it dynamically by toggling the switch button based on the dark mode state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-handling-the-state-of-the-dark-mode-toggle-updating-the-theme-dynamically-based-on-the-dark-mode-state"&gt;Handling the state of the Dark Mode toggle, updating the theme dynamically based on the Dark Mode state&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You noticed that when we switch on the button, it doesn’t change the theme, it is because the state is not being handled to update the theme dynamically. We now see how we can update the theme dynamically based on the dark mode state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To switch the theme dynamically, we are going to render a conditional condition in the &lt;code&gt;darkTheme&lt;/code&gt; mode within our App.js file as given below:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;const darkTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: toggleDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light', 
    ...
  },
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, If you have followed all the steps correctly, your App.js will finally look like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";
import { Card, CardContent, CardMedia, Switch, Typography } from "@mui/material"

export default function App() {

  // state to manage the dark mode
  const [toggleDarkMode, setToggleDarkMode] = useState(true);

  // function to toggle the dark mode as true or false
  const toggleDarkTheme = () =&gt; {
    setToggleDarkMode(!toggleDarkMode);
  };

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      mode: toggleDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light', // handle the dark mode state on toggle
      primary: {
        main: '#90caf9',
      },
      secondary: {
        main: '#131052',

      },
    },
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&gt;Toggle Dark mode&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={toggleDarkMode} onChange={toggleDarkTheme} /&gt;
        {/* rendering the card component with card content */}
        &amp;lt;Card sx={{ width: '30%', borderRadius: 3, padding: 1 }}&gt;
          &amp;lt;CardContent&gt;
            &amp;lt;CardMedia sx={{ height: 180, borderRadius: 3 }} image="https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg" title="semaphore" /&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="h4" component="div" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}&gt;
              Programming Blogs
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }} color="text.secondary"&gt;
              by Semaphore
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="body1"&gt;
              Checkout the latest blogs on Semaphore. Semaphore provides you the best CI/CD solution
              for high-performance engineering teams.
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
          &amp;lt;/CardContent&gt;
        &amp;lt;/Card&gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the given code, we have used conditional rendering in the palette mode to dynamically update the dark mode theme in React. We have assigned the value of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;toggleDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light'&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;property which indicates that when&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;toggleDarkMode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is true, the theme&amp;#8217;s mode is set to &amp;#8216;dark&amp;#8217;, else it will be set to &amp;#8216;light&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-run-the-application"&gt;Run the application&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we have successfully learned how we can add the dark mode functionality in React using Material UI, let’s see the output of the above program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To run the application of react, in your terminal run the below command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Go to localhost:port, and see the output. The output of the given code will look like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-21889" height="520" src="https://wpblog.semaphoreci.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f71524f437161352e706e67.gif" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s all folks! Now, you have successfully learned the complete process to add dark mode in React using Material UI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you&amp;#8217;ve gained an understanding of how to add dark mode into React using Material UI. By integrating a dark theme you can enhance the user experience by providing an appealing and eye-friendly alternative theme.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The step-by-step instructions outlined in the tutorial make it easy for you to seamlessly set up and switch between light modes giving your users a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing interface.

And just as financial services experiences its cycles, this time of year I find myself returning to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/does-cost-reduction-play-a-role-in-digital-transformation/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;topic of cost reduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Financial services institutions are constantly challenged to strike the delicate balance between innovation and cost-saving as they seek out opportunities to decrease expenses while funding new application development projects. Historically, firms have relied on high-cost, third-party solutions to help identify savings opportunities, however, the landscape is rapidly changing, and the emergence of AI and machine learning (ML) has ushered in a new era of possibilities. These cutting-edge technologies provide lower-cost alternatives for discovering efficiencies within financial operations, all while enhancing the quality of services offered. In this dynamic environment, harnessing the power of AI and ML is proving to be a game-changer for firms seeking to thrive in an increasingly competitive market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The use cases for these technologies continue to expand and improve, shaping the industry in ways we could only dream of. In fact, some of the insights presented in this blog have been assisted by the power of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the synergy between human expertise and AI-driven insights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this year’s post, I’ve collected cost-reduction strategies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;augmented by the capabilities of generative AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and innovative approaches that promise to accelerate cost-reduction and reshape the financial services landscape in the year ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;New technology means new opportunities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;AI generally and ML, generative AI, and LLMs specifically, have the potential to significantly reduce costs for financial services at large by automating tasks, improving productivity, and reducing the need for manual labor. And by investing in these technologies, companies gain the added benefits of increasing competitive advantage and improving customer experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Although this list is not exhaustive, I’ve provided an at-a-glance aggregate of use cases for quick wins, quicker wins, and longer-term strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) and Chatbots&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Chatbots, or virtual assistants powered by generative AI, can be used to create customer-facing and employee-facing tools that assess user requests and provide personalized responses, reducing the need for human representatives and related costs. They can provide instant and accurate responses to common customer queries such as account balance, transaction history, loan information, and general banking procedures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;An EKB can be used to assist employees in accessing accurate and up-to-date product, regulatory compliance, and internal IT support information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Research and Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automate the process of gathering, analyzing, and reporting financial data and market trends, reducing the time and cost of manual research for faster decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Analyze a portfolio of investments and identify opportunities to optimize returns while managing risk. This can help investors reduce the time and cost of manual portfolio management and potentially improve investment performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Generation, Text Classification, and Clustering&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automate website content for FAQs and help sections, keeping customer-facing content up to date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automatically create personalized messages, account statements, and transaction summaries, and notify customers of upcoming events or offers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Group customers based on their transaction history, demographics, behavior patterns, and other relevant data to improve marketing and personalization outcomes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Detect patterns and indicators of potential fraudulent activities using transaction data, customer profiles, and other relevant information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quick wins!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal and Compliance&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarizing regulatory requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;AI can summarize regulatory requirements by analyzing large volumes of regulatory texts and extracting key information, making it easier for financial services firms to understand and comply with complex regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating compliance monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Analyzing and interpreting regulatory texts is time consuming, but AI can automate these tasks to help financial services firms understand and comply with complex regulations, saving time and costs associated with manual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;compliance monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing regulatory change management:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Financial services firms must stay up to date with regulatory changes by monitoring and analyzing regulatory updates. AI can enable them to quickly adapt their compliance processes and reduce the risk of non-compliance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving regulatory reporting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; AI can automate the process of generating regulatory reports, ensuring accuracy and consistency while reducing the time and effort required for manual reporting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expedited legal research:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generative AI tools can quickly search and analyze relevant case law, legislation, and secondary sources, enabling legal professionals to access pertinent information with ease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quickest wins!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Translation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilingual customer service:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;With generative AI, customer support representatives can communicate effectively with customers who may not speak the bank&amp;#8217;s primary language. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document translation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; When collaborating with multinational groups, generative AI can translate contracts, agreements, policies, and other legal/ business documents ensuring accurate written communication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Development and Testing Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code generation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;One of the benefits of generative AI is that it can be used to generate code automatically, reducing the time and effort required by developers. By analyzing existing code and patterns, generative AI algorithms can generate new code that is optimized for specific use cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Generative AI can be used to generate test cases automatically, reducing the time and effort required for developers to test their code. By analyzing the code and identifying potential edge cases, generative AI algorithms can generate test cases that cover a wide range of scenarios.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Identifying and fixing bugs in code is essential for application security. By analyzing the code and identifying potential issues, generative AI algorithms can suggest fixes that can be implemented by developers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;By analyzing the code and identifying potential optimizations, generative AI can update code automatically, improving performance and reducing resource usage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthetic data generation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generative AI can generate synthetic data for testing purposes and for training machine learning models, helping developers improve the accuracy of their models and make more informed decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated documentation generation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generating documentation is time consuming and tedious. AI can automatically generate documentation as developers write code, reducing the need for manual documentation while improving efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code comments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generative AI can be used to generate code comments that describe the function and purpose of each element of the code, helping developers identify inconsistencies or potential sources of errors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding legacy code:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Generative AI can be used to analyze and understand the structure and functionality of legacy code, making it easier for developers to work with and maintain, including:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generating unit tests:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automatically generate unit tests for legacy code, helping developers identify and fix potential issues and improve code quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code refactoring:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Assist in refactoring legacy code by suggesting improvements and identifying potential sources of bugs or inefficiencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translating legacy code to modern languages:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Translate legacy code written in outdated languages, such as COBOL, to more modern languages, making it easier to maintain and integrate with newer systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Utilizing AI and its related technologies for cost reduction may seem like a huge lift, but the opportunities in financial services are many, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/generative-ai-for-the-enterprise/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;overcoming the perceived challenges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is getting easier every day.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These engineers typically have some high level metrics about their network traffic, but they struggle to collect essential information on the specific traffic flows that would clarify the issue. To solve this problem, Cloudflare has been piloting a cloud network flow monitoring product called &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; that gives customers end-to-end visibility into all traffic across their network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Cloudflare is excited to announce that Magic Network Monitoring (previously called &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/flow-based-monitoring-for-magic-transit/"&gt;Flow Based Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;) is now generally available to all enterprise customers. Over the last year, the Cloudflare engineering team has significantly improved Magic Network Monitoring; we’re excited to offer a network services product that will help our customers identify threats faster, reduce vulnerabilities, and make their network more secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring is automatically enabled for all Magic Transit and Magic WAN enterprise customers. The product is located at the account level of the Cloudflare dashboard and can be opened by navigating to “Analytics &amp;amp; Logs &amp;gt; Magic Monitoring”. The onboarding process for Magic Network Monitoring is self-serve, and all enterprise customers with access can begin configuring the product today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any enterprise customers without Magic Transit or Magic WAN that are interested in testing Magic Network Monitoring can receive access to the free version (with some &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/magic-network-monitoring-free/"&gt;limitations&lt;/a&gt; on traffic volume) by submitting a request to their Cloudflare account team or filling out this form to &lt;a href="http://network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;talk with an expert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-magic-network-monitoring"&gt;What is Magic Network Monitoring?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring is a cloud network flow monitor. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_flow_(computer_networking)"&gt;Network traffic flow&lt;/a&gt; refers to any stream of packets between one source and one destination with the same Internet protocol and set of ports. Customers can send network flow reports from their routers (or any other network flow generator) to a publicly available endpoint on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/"&gt;Cloudflare’s anycast network&lt;/a&gt;, even if the traffic didn’t originally pass through Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare analyzes the network flow data, then provides customers visibility into key network traffic metrics via an analytics dashboard. These metrics include: traffic volume (in bits or packets) over time, source IPs, destination IPs, ports, traffic protocols, and router IPs. Customers can also configure alerts to identify &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;DDoS attacks&lt;/a&gt; and any other abnormal traffic volume activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="802" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/1-1.png" width="1435" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Send flow data from your network to Cloudflare for analysis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="enterprise-ddos-attack-type-detection"&gt;Enterprise DDoS attack type detection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/on-demand/"&gt;Magic Transit On Demand&lt;/a&gt; (MTOD) customers will experience significant traffic visibility benefits when using Magic Network Monitoring. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/"&gt;Magic Transit&lt;/a&gt; is a network security solution that offers DDoS protection and traffic acceleration from every Cloudflare data center for on-premise, cloud-hosted, and hybrid networks. Magic Transit On Demand customers can activate Magic Transit for protection when a DDoS attack is detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, we noticed that some MTOD customers lacked the network visibility tools to quickly identify DDoS attacks and take the appropriate mitigation action. Now, MTOD customers can use Magic Network Monitoring to analyze their network data and receive an alert if a DDoS attack is detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="761" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/2-1.png" width="1436" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cloudflare detects a DDoS attack from the customer’s network flow data&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a DDoS attack is detected, Magic Network Monitoring customers can choose to either manually or automatically enable Magic Transit to mitigate any DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="761" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/3-1.png" width="1436" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Activate Magic Transit for DDoS protection&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="enterprise-network-monitoring"&gt;Enterprise network monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s Magic WAN and Cloudflare One customers can also benefit from using Magic Network Monitoring. Today, these customers have excellent visibility into the traffic they send through Cloudflare’s network, but sometimes they may lack visibility into traffic that isn’t sent through Cloudflare. This can include traffic that remains on a local network, or network traffic sent in between cloud environments. Magic WAN and Cloudflare One customers can add Magic Network Monitoring into their suite of product solutions to establish end-to-end network visibility across all traffic on their network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="a-deep-dive-into-network-flow-and-network-traffic-sampling"&gt;A deep dive into network flow and network traffic sampling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring gives customers better visibility into their network traffic by ingesting and analyzing network flow data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process starts when a router (or other network flow generation device) collects &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"&gt;statistical samples&lt;/a&gt; of inbound and / or outbound packet data. These samples are collected by examining 1 in every X packets, where X is the sampling rate configured on the router. Typical sampling rates range from 1 in every 1,000 to 1 in every 4,000 packets. The ideal sampling rate depends on the traffic volume, traffic diversity, and the compute / memory power of your router’s hardware. You can read more about the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/routers/recommended-sampling-rate/"&gt;recommended network flow sampling rate&lt;/a&gt; in Cloudflare’s MNM Developer Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sampled data is packaged into one of two industry standard formats for network flow data: NetFlow or sFlow. In NetFlow, the sampled packet data is grouped by different packet characteristics such as source / destination IP, port, and protocol. Each group of sampled packet data also includes a traffic volume estimate. In sFlow, the entire packet header is selected as the representative sample, and there isn’t any data summarization. As a result, sFlow is a richer data format and includes more details about network traffic than NetFlow data. Once either the NetFlow or sFlow data samples are collected, they’re sent to Magic Network Monitoring for analysis and alerting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="400" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/4-1.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="why-simple-random-sampling-didn%E2%80%99t-work-for-magic-network-monitoring"&gt;Why simple random sampling didn’t work for Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring has come a long way from its early access release one year ago. In particular, the Cloudflare engineering team invested significant time in improving the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations in MNM. In the early access version of Magic Network Monitoring, customers were unexpectedly reporting that their network traffic volume estimates were too high and didn’t match the expected value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring performs its own sampling of the NetFlow or sFlow data it receives, so it can effectively scale and manage the data ingested across Cloudflare’s global network. Increasing the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations was more difficult than expected, as the NetFlow or sFlow data parsed by MNM is already built on sampled packet data. This introduces multiple distinct layers of data sampling in the product’s analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first version of Magic Network Monitoring used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample"&gt;random sampling&lt;/a&gt; where a random subset of network flow data with the same timestamp was selected to represent the traffic volume at that point in time. A characteristic of network flow data is that some samples are more significant than others and represent a greater volume of network traffic. In order to account for this significance, we can associate a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; with each sample based on the traffic volume it represents. Network flow data weights are always positive numbers, and they follow a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail"&gt;long tail distribution&lt;/a&gt;. These data characteristics caused MNM’s random sampling to incorrectly estimate the traffic volume of a customer’s network. Customers would see false spikes in their traffic volume analytics when an outlying data sample from the long tail was randomly selected to be the representative of all traffic at that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="400" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/5-1.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="increasing-accuracy-with-varopt-reservoir-sampling"&gt;Increasing accuracy with VarOpt reservoir sampling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, the Cloudflare engineering team implemented an alternative &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling"&gt;reservoir sampling&lt;/a&gt; technique called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0473.pdf"&gt;VarOpt&lt;/a&gt;. VarOpt is designed to collect samples from a stream of data when the length of the data stream is unknown (a perfect application for analyzing incoming network flow data). In the MNM implementation of VarOpt, we start with an empty reservoir of a fixed size that is filled with samples of network flow data. When the reservoir is full, and there is still new incoming network flow data, an old sample is randomly discarded from the reservoir and replaced with a new one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a certain number of samples have been observed, we calculate the traffic volume across all weighted samples in the reservoir, and that is the estimated traffic volume of a customer’s network flow at that point in time. Finally, the reservoir is emptied, and the VarOpt loop is restarted by filling the reservoir with the next set of the latest network flow samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new VarOpt sampling method significantly increased the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations in Magic Network Monitoring, and solved our customer’s problems. These sampling improvements paved the way for general availability, and we’re excited to make accurate network flow analytics available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="320" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/6-1.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="developer-docs-and-discord-community"&gt;Developer Docs and Discord Community&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are detailed &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;Developer Docs for Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; that explain the product’s features and outlines a step-by-step configuration guide for new customers.

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231018-00/?p=108904</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A customer had code that used the &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue.Has­Thread­Access&lt;/code&gt; property, but found that the code crashed when running on Windows Server 2019 systems,¹ because the &lt;code&gt;Has­Thread­Access&lt;/code&gt; property wasn&amp;#8217;t added until Windows Server Version 1903.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wondered if there was a way to find out whether you are running on a &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8216;s thread without using the &lt;code&gt;Has­Thread­Access&lt;/code&gt; property?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let&amp;#8217;s browse around the members of &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Member&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Available in Server 2019?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GetForCurrentThread&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CreateTimer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TryEnqueue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ShutdownStaring&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ShutdownCompleted&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HasThreadAccess&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that you can see if a particular &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt; belongs to the current thread by simply reversing the question: Ask the current thread for its &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt; and see if it&amp;#8217;s the one you were given. This relies on the fact that each thread can have at most one &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;// Alternate version that simulates HasThreadAccess
// on Windows Server 2019.

// C++/WinRT
bool DispatcherQueueHasThreadAccess(DispatcherQueue const&amp;amp; q)
{
    ASSERT(q != nullptr); // caller should have checked this first
    return q == DispatcherQueue::GetForCurrentThread();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer reported back that it worked great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of computer programming is just looking at the tools you have available in your toolbox and seeing whether you can combine them in an interesting way to accomplish your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¹ Still in extended support until 2029!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Python's F-String for String Interpolation and Formatting</title>
      <link>https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python &lt;strong&gt;f-strings&lt;/strong&gt; provide a quick way to &lt;strong&gt;interpolate&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;format&lt;/strong&gt; strings. They’re readable, concise, and less prone to error than traditional string interpolation and formatting tools, such as the &lt;code&gt;.format()&lt;/code&gt; method and the modulo operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;). An f-string is also a bit faster than those tools!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know why f-strings are such a powerful tool that you should learn and master as a Python developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpolate&lt;/strong&gt; values, objects, and expressions into your strings using &lt;strong&gt;f-strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Format&lt;/strong&gt; f-strings using Python’s &lt;strong&gt;string formatting mini-language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage some &lt;strong&gt;cool features&lt;/strong&gt; of f-strings in Python 3.12 and beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide when to use &lt;strong&gt;traditional interpolation&lt;/strong&gt; tools instead of &lt;strong&gt;f-strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with Python’s &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-strings/"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; data type. It’s also be beneficial to have experience with other string interpolation tools like the modulo operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) and the &lt;code&gt;.format()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Your Code:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="alert-link" href="https://realpython.com/bonus/python-f-string-code/"&gt;Click here to download the free sample code&lt;/a&gt; that shows you how to do string interpolation and formatting with Python’s f-strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="interpolating-and-formatting-strings-before-python-36"&gt;Interpolating and Formatting Strings Before Python 3.6&lt;a class="headerlink" href="https://realpython.com/atom.xml#interpolating-and-formatting-strings-before-python-36" title="Permanent link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Python 3.6, you had two main tools for interpolating values, variables, and expressions inside string literals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting"&gt;string interpolation operator&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;), or modulo operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format"&gt;&lt;code&gt;str.format()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll get a refresher on these two string interpolation tools in the following sections. You’ll also learn about the string formatting capabilities that these tools offer in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-modulo-operator"&gt;The Modulo Operator, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a class="headerlink" href="https://realpython.com/atom.xml#the-modulo-operator" title="Permanent link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modulo operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) was the first tool for string interpolation and formatting in Python and has been in the language since the beginning. Here’s what using this operator looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jane"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;!"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;'Hello, Jane!'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this quick example, you use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator to interpolate the value of your &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; variable into a string literal. The interpolation operator takes two operands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A string literal containing one or more conversion specifiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The object or objects that you’re interpolating into the string literal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;conversion specifiers&lt;/strong&gt; work as replacement fields. In the above example, you use the &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; combination of characters as a conversion specifier. The &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; symbol marks the start of the specifier, while the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; letter is the &lt;strong&gt;conversion type&lt;/strong&gt; and tells the operator that you want to convert the input object into a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to insert more than one object into your target string, then you can use a &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-tuple/"&gt;tuple&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the number of objects in the tuple must match the number of format specifiers in the string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jane"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;! You're &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; years old."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;'Hello, Jane! You're 25 years old.'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, you use a tuple of values as the right-hand operand to &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. Note that you’ve used a string and an integer. Because you use the &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; specifier, Python converts both objects to strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use dictionaries as the right-hand operand in your interpolation expressions. To do this, you need to create conversion specifiers that enclose key names in parentheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(name)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;! You're &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(age)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; years old."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jane"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;"Hello, Jane! You're 25 years old."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This syntax provides a readable approach to string interpolation with the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator. You can use descriptive key names instead of relying on the positional order of values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator for string interpolation, you can use conversion specifiers. They provide some string formatting capabilities that take advantage of &lt;strong&gt;conversion types&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;conversion flags&lt;/strong&gt;, and some characters like the period (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) and the asterisk (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;). Consider the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Balance: $&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%.2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;5425.9292&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;'Balance: $5425.93'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Age: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"John"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Name: John&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Age:    35&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first example, you use the &lt;code&gt;%.2f&lt;/code&gt; conversion specifier to represent currency values. The &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; letter tells the operator to convert to a floating-point number. The &lt;code&gt;.2&lt;/code&gt; part defines the precision to use when converting the input. In the second example, you use &lt;code&gt;%5s&lt;/code&gt; to align the age value five positions to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Safe URLs 101: Spotting the Red Flags</title>
      <link>https://catonmat.net/safe-urls-101</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TLDR: You can use &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; (that I and my team built) to check if a URL is safe or not. We run browsers in the cloud in virtual machines and you get a remote connection to a browser. This way, you can open any bad URLs without the risk of infecting your device as everything runs in this this remote browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world has become digitally interconnected, the importance of being able to discern between safe and unsafe URLs has never been more relevant. Unsafe URLs can lead to malware infections, phishing attempts, and breaches of personal data. In this article, I'll tell you everything I know (I have 20 years of experience in web security) about how to distinguish between safe and unsafe URLs and how to use &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; to spot and avoid these digital landmines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the URL structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before delving into the signs of an unsafe URL, it's crucial to know the basic parts of a URL. A URL can be broken into seven parts: protocol scheme, subdomain, domain, top level domain (TLD), path, query string, and anchor. Let's look at each part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protocol Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the initial part of a web address that determines the communication protocol or a program that will be used to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;mailto&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;, which is secure version of the HTTP protocol used for online communication, ensuring data is encrypted and transmitted safely between a user's device and a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Domain Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main part of a web address. It's a human-readable address that uniquely identifies a website or online resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yahoo.com&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;digg.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subdomain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the optional part before a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;shop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;, which is a commonly used prefix in web addresses, denoting &amp;quot;World Wide Web&amp;quot;, and it serves as a standard subdomain for almost all websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Top-Level Domain (TLD)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending segment of a web address, indicating the domain's type, category or country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.it&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A specific page on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/account&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;/resources/free/downloads&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/blog&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt;, which leads users to the blog section or another page of a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Query String&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part starts with a question mark &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and allows sending parameters to a page, and it's often in the format of &lt;code&gt;key=value&lt;/code&gt; pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;?id=123&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?search=python&amp;amp;sort=date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=puppies&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;?q=puppies&lt;/code&gt;, which loads the search query for puppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anchor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anchor is used to direct you to a specific section of a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;#footer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;#tools&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/blog#top-posts&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;#top-posts&lt;/code&gt;, which scrolls the webpage to the top posts section of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Full URL Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;https://www.google.com/blog/post?id=123#tools&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheme: &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subdomain: &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain Name: &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-Level Domain (TLD): &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path: &lt;code&gt;/blog/post&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query String: &lt;code&gt;?id=123&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor: &lt;code&gt;#tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spotting Unsafe URLs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 15 signs that can help you identify and avoid unsafe URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Mismatched URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hover over a link to see where it leads to. If the hover link doesn't match the URL or the title in the text, be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a ligature used in place of a letter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says &lt;code&gt;Bank of America&lt;/code&gt; but hover is &lt;code&gt;bankofarnerica.com&lt;/code&gt; (the letters &amp;quot;rn&amp;quot; are combined together to create a ligature that looks like letter &amp;quot;m&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a number used as a letter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says &lt;code&gt;PayPal&lt;/code&gt; but it hovers as &lt;code&gt;paypa1.com&lt;/code&gt; (digit &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; is used in place of the letter el - &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Misspelled Domains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typos or slight variations of popular domain names can lead to malicious websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of misspelled Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You search for a book and click on a link that seems to lead to &lt;code&gt;amazon.com&lt;/code&gt;, but a closer look reveals it says &lt;code&gt;amazom.com&lt;/code&gt; (last letter is &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of misspelled Facebook&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You try logging into &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt; but find yourself at &lt;code&gt;facebokk.com&lt;/code&gt; instead (instead of &amp;quot;book&amp;quot;, it says &amp;quot;bokk&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Unicode characters in URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs that contain fake Unicode characters pose a great danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a homoglyph attack&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching for a Samsung phone update, you find a link to &lt;code&gt;ѕаmѕung.соm&lt;/code&gt;. It turns out this address is fake as it replaces standard characters with visually similar Unicode characters (called homoglyphs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a Punycode deception&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're searching for a security product and visit &lt;code&gt;security.com&lt;/code&gt; but after visiting, your browser shows &lt;code&gt;xn--scurity-w4a.com&lt;/code&gt; in the address bar. The real address was &lt;code&gt;sécurity.com&lt;/code&gt; and the browser converted it to an international domain name (IDN) encoding called Punycode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Unusual Top-Level Domain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncommon TLDs that don't align with the site's supposed purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a government website at a .kim domain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for a government service, you stumble upon &lt;code&gt;GovernmentAgency.kim&lt;/code&gt;, which doesn't feel official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a clothing brand's website at a .horse domain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for an Italian clothing brand's site but land on &lt;code&gt;ItalianBrand.horse&lt;/code&gt;, which seems inconsistent with their product line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Excessive Redirects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs that send you through multiple sites rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake online deal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're hoping to snag an online deal at &lt;code&gt;greatoffer90.com&lt;/code&gt;, but you find yourself being bounced between multiple unrelated websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake movie website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trying to watch a movie on &lt;code&gt;freemoviesnow.com&lt;/code&gt; but the page keeps shifting and redirecting, never settling on the content you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. URL Shorteners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services that conceal the end destination of a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a bit.ly link&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend sends you a &lt;code&gt;bit.ly&lt;/code&gt; link (such as &lt;code&gt;bit.ly/XXXXX&lt;/code&gt; and you can't determine its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a tinyurl.com link&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email offers a great discount, but the link is a shortened &lt;code&gt;tinyurl.com/XXXXX&lt;/code&gt;, hiding its true endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Generic Greetings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emails or messages that come with vague salutations instead of personalized greetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an impersonal account update email&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email asks you to update your account details &lt;code&gt;for security reasons&lt;/code&gt; with a link reading &lt;code&gt;accountupdate.com&lt;/code&gt; and an impersonal greeting of &lt;code&gt;Dear valued member&lt;/code&gt; (instead of your name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a lucky visitor popup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notification pops up, claiming you're a lucky visitor and you've won a prize and urging you to visit &lt;code&gt;surprisewin.com&lt;/code&gt; with the salutation &lt;code&gt;Hello user&lt;/code&gt; (instead of your name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Unsolicited Invitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected URLs from known and unknown senders can be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an invitation to an unknown photo site&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from an unknown sender urging you to see an amazing photo at &lt;code&gt;checkoutthisphoto.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an invitation to view a PDF file&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive a message saying a colleague has shared a PDF document on &lt;code&gt;seemyresume.net&lt;/code&gt;, but you weren't expecting any such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. Too-Good-To-Be-True Offers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promising deals or prizes that seem too generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a link to huge winnings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ad claims you can win a million dollars instantly, directing you to &lt;code&gt;win-1million-now.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unexpected prize&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive an email promising a free top-end smartphone for every form that you fill at &lt;code&gt;freesmartphones.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Alarmist Messages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites that induce panic to make you act quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a popup asking you to act quickly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pop-up warns of suspicious activity on your account and insists you visit &lt;code&gt;urgent-account-alert.com&lt;/code&gt; to resolve it or else your account will be suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an alert telling your PC has been infected with a virus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alert pops up saying your PC has been infected with a virus and asks you to fix your PC by visiting &lt;code&gt;instant-pcfixer.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. Grammar and Spelling Errors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes in the URL and link text can indicate deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a login page with a typo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trying to access a login page and you find the link reads &lt;code&gt;officiall-login.com&lt;/code&gt;, with a duplicate letter &amp;quot;el&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a grammar and spelling error in text surrounding the link&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive an email from an online payment service but it says &lt;code&gt;Varifay, your acount to login&lt;/code&gt;, with terrible grammar and spelling errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. Inconsistent Branding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website's design or URL structure doesn't match the known branding of a reputed entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a broken logo on Google's login page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You click on a Google login page, but something feels off. The page URL &lt;code&gt;google-securelogin.com&lt;/code&gt; and the logo is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake Apple support page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Apple support, the site you land on has a web address &lt;code&gt;applesupports.org&lt;/code&gt;, which is nicely made, but doesn't align with Apple's official domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;13. No Contact Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absence of genuine contact details on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake product support site&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an issue with a product, you try reaching out via &lt;code&gt;contactsupportnow.com&lt;/code&gt;, but the site has just one page and lacks any genuine contact details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a page with no contact details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needing customer care, &lt;code&gt;customercareinfo.net&lt;/code&gt; appears to offer support but has no phone number or physical address listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;14. Unexpected Software Downloads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs that initiate unsolicited software or file downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unexpected download&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to listen to some new music tracks, you click on &lt;code&gt;freemusicdownloader.com&lt;/code&gt;, only for it to start downloading an unexpected executable file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a download without your consent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend suggests a cool new app, but &lt;code&gt;getthisappnow.com&lt;/code&gt; initiates an unsolicited software download without your consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;15. Lack of HTTPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A missing secure protocol can indicate the site isn't encrypted, which can lead to personal data and credit card exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unsafe banking website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A banking website that doesn't use https: &lt;code&gt;http://yourbanklogin.com&lt;/code&gt;. Here instead of &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; it uses &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unsafe payment portal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secure payments portal that doesn't use HTTPS: &lt;code&gt;http://secure-paymentportal.com&lt;/code&gt;. Here, again, it uses unsecure &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol instead of secure &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Browserling Can Help You Spot Unsafe URLs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I dove deep into 15 key signs that can help you identify potentially malicious URLs, it's essential to understand that the digital landscape of unsafe URLs is vast and ever-evolving. In many respects, I've just skimmed the surface of the complex world of cybersecurity threats related to URLs. Fortunately, my service &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; stands as a bulwark against these diverse threats and offers a secure layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Browserling?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browserling is a web-based service that offers real-time remote access to sandboxed browsers that allow users to run browsers from different operating systems directly in their own browser. As the browsers are sandboxed, the browsing sessions are isolated, making it especially useful for testing potentially unsafe URLs without risking one's own system or data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interactive Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browserling isn't just a passive tool. It offers a live and interactive browsing experience that can help security professionals recognize unusual site behaviors, from unexpected redirects to aggressive pop-ups, and other potential red flags not covered in the initial 15 signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cross-Browser Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals sometimes exploit browser-specific and platform-specific vulnerabilities. For example, they might target Chrome version 115 that runs on Windows 10. Browserling's capability to test URLs across multiple browsers and platforms means you're not just looking for general threats, but also those that are browser-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zero Additional Risks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no required downloads, installs, or extensions, Browserling ensures that your safety isn't compromised by adding potential vulnerabilities. Every interaction is web-based, keeping a safe distance from potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clean State Every Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each session with Browserling is temporary and wiped clean after use. This clean up of session data guarantees that no malware, viruses, cookies, or trackers linger post-investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Secure Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browserling prioritizes user data privacy and security with SSL-encrypted connections. This ensures that, while you're investigating a URL, your connection remains invisible to potential eavesdroppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of unsafe URLs extends far beyond the 15 signs I initially outlined. With Browserling, users are equipped with an advanced tool offering both breadth and depth in analysis and defense against the countless URL-based cyber threats. &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com/browse"&gt;Give it a try&lt;/a&gt; and browse safe!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PKI hosting: Cloud-based PKI vs. self managed</title>
      <link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/pki-hosting-cloud-based-pki-vs-self-managed</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaaS solutions for public key infrastructure (PKI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cloud-based PKI vs on-premises PKI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advantages of cloud-based PKI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HashiCorp Vault for PKI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;self-managed PKI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKI的介绍，包括常见的应用场景和核心流程&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;云端PKI和HCP Vault，包括服务模型和优势&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在HCP Vault上运行PKI的好处，如降低操作负担、增加安全性、控制成本、提高可靠性和易用性&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自管理PKI的好处，如控制、灵活性、自主性、安全性和合规性&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HashiCorp为PKI提供的解决方案&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文探讨了在云端和自管理环境中托管PKI环境的因素和考虑事项。云端PKI在降低操作负担、提高安全性、控制成本、可靠性和易用性方面具有优势。然而，自管理PKI在满足特定的合规性和监管要求方面更加灵活。HashiCorp的HCP Vault和Vault Enterprise提供了满足不同需求的PKI解决方案。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many organizations are leveraging SaaS solutions for public key infrastructure (PKI) to protect their workloads in the cloud. However, PKI running in self-managed environments also remains a popular choice, and is a requirement for some highly regulated industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are important factors organizations need to consider before deciding which option is the best choice for their requirements, but the advantages of cloud-based PKI versus an on-premises approach are not always well understood. This blog explores the factors organizations should consider when deciding how to host their PKI environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PKI explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PKI is the standard process for provisioning and maintaining digital certificates for authentication and encryption of digital identities associated with users, devices, and applications. Common PKI use cases include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL and TLS certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Device and endpoint certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code signing certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital signatures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing access to APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate-based VPNs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a simplified illustration of the core PKI process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="PKI" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1697504081-pki-process.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public key cryptography is the foundation of PKI. It is a strong encryption mechanism that relies on public and private key pairs. The keys are used together to encrypt and decrypt messages based on cryptographic algorithms, helping to protect identities and data from unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cloud PKI and HCP Vault&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of this post, cloud PKI refers to a service or hosting model in the cloud where a service provider hosts and manages the infrastructure and the customer is responsible for the certificate authority (CA), as well as the PKI environment for provisioning and managing certificates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With self-managed PKI, workloads may be hosted in a cloud environment or a more traditional on-premises datacenter. With a self-managed approach, the organization is responsible for maintaining the PKI infrastructure and operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look into the delivery models for &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault"&gt;HashiCorp Vault&lt;/a&gt; can help make it clear what options are available and which one might be best for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HashiCorp’s cloud PKI functionality resides in &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault"&gt;HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault&lt;/a&gt;. HCP Vault is a fully managed implementation of Vault operated by HashiCorp, allowing organizations to get up and running quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an organization chooses to allow a public connection, the HCP Vault cluster will have an associated public address where clients can directly connect to Vault. (Most organizations disable the public connection for security reasons.) The organization can then establish a peering connection between its cloud provider and a HashiCorp virtual network (HVN). This ensures that only trusted clients (users, applications, containers, etc.) running in the peered public cloud provider can connect to Vault and stops systems outside of the selected network from attempting to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="PKI" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1697504191-pki-infrastructure.png" /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of PKI on HCP Vault&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running PKI on HCP enables users to secure, store, and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys within one unified cloud-based platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key benefits of running cloud PKI on HCP Vault include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced operational overhead:&lt;/strong&gt; Push-button deployment as well as fully managed upgrades and backups mean organizations can focus on adoption and integration instead of operational overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased security across clouds and machines:&lt;/strong&gt; HCP Vault allows organizations to secure their globally diverse infrastructure and applications through a single management interface, to restrict access to sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced operating costs due to HashiCorp's engineers running and maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; HashiCorp has experience supporting thousands of commercial Vault clusters and HCP Vault brings that expertise directly to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of use:&lt;/strong&gt; HCP Vault is built around making onboarding its cloud security automation simple. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of self-managed PKI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A managed product like HCP Vault brings many benefits, but organizations should also consider their particular needs when choosing how and where to host their PKI environment. Frequently, those needs are driven by compliance and regulatory requirements associated with specific industries, where self-managed hosting may be appropriate. Self-managed Vault comes in two editions: A free community edition for small use cases, and Vault Enterprise for larger organizations or organizations with stricter security requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of a running a self-managed PKI environment with Vault include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control:&lt;/strong&gt; The certificate provisioning, revocation, and rotation process is within your control, and you are not limited when accessing the cloud. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; On-premises management can be more flexible in terms of customization based on the requirements and capacity of the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-reliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Since critical data is kept in-house, configuration changes can be done on-premises and on your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security and compliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud service providers don’t always support the compliance and standards required for particular industries. Self-managed environments allow organizations to customize their environments for their specific compliance needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;HashiCorp and PKI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, both cloud-based and self-managed PKI solutions have their pros and cons. That’s why HashiCorp offers multiple ways to address your PKI needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud PKI offers agility, ease of use, and reduced operational overhead, whereas self-managed PKI offers more options to customize and meet specific security and compliance requirements. HashiCorp can meet your organization’s needs for not only both types of PKI, but both cloud-based or self-managed certificate lifecycle management platforms (CLM), which is a broader effort to secure identity information and implement data protection to secure your users, devices, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
