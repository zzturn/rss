      <title>Scrum Your Money, Part 2: Transparency and Ceremonies</title>
      <link>https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/11/18/scrum-money-transparency/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/11/17/scrum-your-money-values/"&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; of this Scrum Your Money series, I explained scrum values and establishing a positive money mindset. In part two, I will cover the importance of money transparency and using sprint ceremonies to inspect and adapt your money progress. &lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. Please discuss your specific situation with a financial advisor. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html"&gt;The Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt; states that, “with sufficient transparency, an agile team can inspect and adapt.” This means that for a Scrum team to improve and make progress, there needs to be a high level of openness and visibility into the work being done. Remember your money team? Whether it&amp;#8217;s yourself, your family, or a partner &amp;#8211; everyone on your money team needs transparency into the money flows and goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#8217;t know if you’re on track to meet your goals unless you have a budget. I know budgeting gets a bad rap, but budgeting is not just about sacrificing and suffering. Budgets are a tool to display money facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you use an integrated tracker or a simple spreadsheet, budgeting provides the transparency to see your current and projected money flows. These data points can turn frustrating questions (“Where is all my money going?”) into fact-based options (“If I want to increase spending on X, I could reduce spending on Y”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many apps and online tools available for tracking money flow! I love my manual Google spreadsheet, but several coworkers are big fans of &lt;a href="https://www.ynab.com/"&gt;You Need a Budget&lt;/a&gt; (better for tracking day-to-day expenses) and &lt;a href="https://copilot.money/"&gt;Copilot&lt;/a&gt; (better for tracking investments and net worth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I will review scrum ceremonies that build in intentional touchpoints for inspection and adaptation of your budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scrum Ceremonies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum uses &lt;b&gt;sprints &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;ceremonies&lt;/b&gt; to structure periods of work as a team moves towards a product goal. &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/04/02/agile-planning-sprint/"&gt;A sprint&lt;/a&gt; is a short period in which the team commits to complete a set amount of work. Calendar months lend themselves nicely to one-month sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ceremonies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceremonies are regular meetings with specific objectives to review and inspect progress during the sprint to achieve the sprint goals. Just like in Scrum, you should break down your financial journey into sprints. Set short-term money goals for one month at a time and meet before, during, and after the month to inspect and adapt your progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sprint Planning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before each sprint (month), have a &lt;b&gt;sprint planning session&lt;/b&gt; to determine which goals you&amp;#8217;ll work on during the upcoming month. Review what you accomplished the previous month, and what you want to tweak or achieve this upcoming month. This process will help you stay organized, motivated, and aligned with your financial objectives. Since you’ll be tackling one small piece of a goal each month, it&amp;#8217;s easier to stay focused on your progress instead of getting overwhelmed by the big picture. Examples of monthly sprint goals could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase your savings rate by 5% this month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save an extra $500 toward your emergency fund this month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay off your smallest debt this month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these are the goals, how you accomplish them during the month is up to you! Perhaps you come up with extra cash by selling things you no longer need, taking on a side hustle, working an extra shift, canceling a streaming service, or cooking at home three nights a week instead of dining out. During the month you can focus on tracking your expenses, monitoring progress towards your goal, and making any necessary adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Standups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum uses &lt;b&gt;daily standup&lt;/b&gt; meetings to share updates and discuss progress. Apply this practice to your personal finance by having a daily check-in with yourself or your money partner(s). Reflect on your financial activities from the previous day (bills paid, planned spending, surprise expenses, or cleared refunds), discuss any challenges or achievements, and make any necessary adjustments for today to stay on track. If you are using a tracking tool, enter the inflows and outflows for that day. Discuss what purchases or automated bills are expected tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of each month, conduct a &lt;b&gt;sprint review&lt;/b&gt; to assess your financial progress, celebrate accomplishments, and identify areas to improve on next month. This reflection process will help you continuously improve your financial habits and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Review and Reassess&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum encourages a culture of continuous improvement, and the same philosophy should apply to personal finance. Regularly review your financial performance, reassess your goals, and adjust your strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/11/19/scrum-money-create-backlog/"&gt;Part Three&lt;/a&gt; for a beginner’s personal finance backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is a Cloud Browser?</title>
      <link>https://catonmat.net/what-is-a-cloud-browser</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TLDR: A demo speaks louder than a thousand words. You can open a cloud browser created by me and my team via &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com/browse"&gt;browserling.com/browse&lt;/a&gt;. We run cloud browsers on our servers and stream just the browser window to you. No cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud Browser – What Is It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cloud browser is a web browser that operates in a cloud-based virtualized environment, offering enhanced security and privacy compared to traditional browsers. By processing web content on remote servers before delivering it to the user's device, cloud browsers effectively isolate potential security threats, reducing the risk of malware and cyber attacks. This setup is particularly beneficial for enterprise security, as it helps in safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining regulatory compliance. Additionally, cloud browsers can optimize performance by offloading processing tasks to powerful cloud servers, enabling faster browsing experiences even on less powerful devices. Moreover, cloud browsers boast mind-blowing Internet speeds, as they are hosted in fiber optic data centers equipped with gigabit Internet connections, ensuring lightning-fast access to web resources and an ultra-smooth browsing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the Use Cases of Cloud Browsers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enhanced Security and Privacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By isolating browsing activities in a cloud environment, cloud browsers protect against malware and phishing attacks, making them ideal for handling sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Collaborative Browsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud browsers enable multiple users to co-browse and interact with the same web session in real-time, useful for collaborative research and teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Geo-location Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud browsers are ideal for testing geo-specific content and services as they provide an easy way to access the web from different geographical locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recording Browsing Sessions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud browsers enable the recording of browser sessions, crucial for user experience analysis, training, quality assurance, and compliance. These sessions can be captured as GIFs for concise demonstrations or videos for high-quality playbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web Scraping and Automation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud browsers offer a scalable solution for automated data extraction and web scraping tasks, managing high-volume requests without compromising local resources or triggering anti-bot measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cross-Platform Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud browsers enable consistent web experience across different platforms and devices, simplifying web application testing and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Content Filtering and Access Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In educational and corporate settings, cloud browsers can be configured to perform content filtering and access management, ensuring compliance with policies and regulatory standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud browsers offload heavy content rendering to powerful cloud servers, providing a smoother browsing experience on less capable hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bandwidth Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They compress and optimize web content for areas with limited bandwidth, ensuring faster access to web resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Load Testing for Web Applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud browsers can simulate high traffic scenarios, helping developers understand how their applications perform under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anonymous Browsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For users or organizations requiring privacy, cloud browsers can mask IP addresses and browsing activity, ensuring anonymity online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud Browser via Browserling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can instantly run a cloud browser via Browserling. &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; is a cross-browser testing service that enables users to run interactive browser testing sessions in virtual machines. It facilitates testing of websites and web applications across different browsers and operating systems, without the need to install or maintain multiple browsers locally. It's particularly useful for web developers and quality assurance teams who need to ensure compatibility and performance across a diverse range of browser environments. Additionally, the advanced features such as geo-browsing, allowing users to load cloud browsers from different geographic locations, co-browsing for collaborative testing sessions, and the ability to record browsing sessions into GIFs and videos for detailed analysis and reporting make it especially useful for security professionals and broader audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy browsing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Skip PHPUnit Tests Conditionally in PHP</title>
      <link>https://www.amitmerchant.com/skip-a-phpunit-test-conditionally-in-php/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you may want to skip a &lt;a href="https://phpunit.de/"&gt;PHPUnit&lt;/a&gt; test conditionally. For instance, you may want to skip a test if the PHP version is less than 7.4 or if a certain extension is not installed on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about this in &lt;a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/48845/files#diff-c547ec5639f2da21195501634ff9f2e492634de0158eb8085c3c073fb3c730f7R172"&gt;this PR&lt;/a&gt; where the author wanted to skip all the tests if &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;intl&lt;/code&gt; extension is not installed on the system that’s because the code uses PHP’s &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;NumberFormatter&lt;/code&gt; class which is a part of &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;intl&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s how you can skip PHPUnit tests conditionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You define a method in the class where you check for the condition and if the condition is met, you call the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;markTestSkipped()&lt;/code&gt; method (with a message) on the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;$this&lt;/code&gt; object. This will skip the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;needsIntlExtension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;extension_loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'intl'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;markTestSkipped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'The intl extension is not installed. Please install the extension to enable '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;__CLASS__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you call this method in the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;setUp()&lt;/code&gt; method of the test class or at the top of the test method itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;setUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;needsIntlExtension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. Now, if the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;intl&lt;/code&gt; extension is not installed on the system, the test will be skipped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Protecting Webhooks Against OWASP’s Top Ten API Risks</title>
      <link>https://nordicapis.com/protecting-webhooks-against-owasps-top-ten-api-risks/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=protecting-webhooks-against-owasps-top-ten-api-risks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/your-guide-to-webhooks/"&gt;webhook&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight event-driven solution that connects APIs to other APIs, applications, or services. This server-to-server method allows for the modification of resources and services based on a specific event, which triggers an action in a &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/4-business-benefits-of-an-event-driven-architecture-eda/"&gt;push-based approach&lt;/a&gt;. This allows for incredible flexibility and power between services, which has made webhooks a &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/why-your-api-needs-webhooks/"&gt;much-beloved approach&lt;/a&gt; for inter-API communication and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is this power and flexibility that makes webhooks particularly vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/a-look-at-the-owasp-api-security-top-10-2023/"&gt;security issues&lt;/a&gt;. Below, we&amp;#8217;re going to look at some of these webhook vulnerabilities within the context of the OWASP &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/"&gt;API Security Top 10 2023&lt;/a&gt; list. We&amp;#8217;ll first review each vulnerability category and then identify how these weaknesses arise in webhooks technologies and how to resolve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api01-broken-object-level-authorization-bola-"&gt;API01: Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken object-level authorization (&lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/what-is-broken-object-level-authorization-and-how-to-fix-it/"&gt;BOLA&lt;/a&gt;), formerly known as insecure direct object reference (IDOR), is a significant risk in APIs. This vulnerability arises when an API exposes objects without proper authorization checks. An attacker can take advantage of this to access unauthorized data by manipulating input parameters, such as object IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webhooks are susceptible to BOLA issues just like any other web technology. Improperly designed or configured authorization can expose data and functions, with additional tack-on effects allowing for the escalation of attack vectors and compounding threats. Sometimes, this threat can come from non-obvious vectors. For instance, simply authenticating the source of a webhook but not applying specific authorization for objects could lead to an exploit where a legitimate service that is used by a bad-faith actor could be used to escalate damaging attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the risk of BOLA in webhooks, proper authorization checks should be implemented alongside authentication. Object-level security must be employed to ensure that webhooks are validated upon specific objects. When combined with &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/different-algorithms-to-implement-rate-limiting-in-apis/"&gt;rate limiting&lt;/a&gt;, monitoring, and logging, many BOLA attempts could be mitigated before they become significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api02-broken-authentication"&gt;API02: Broken Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability pertains to flaws in authentication mechanisms, which could be abused or bypassed, allowing for a range of attacks. These attacks can be direct (as in data exfiltration) or indirect (as in denial of service attacks through bypassing authentication-based rate limiting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication failure is a disaster scenario for most services, and this is no less true with webhooks. &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/how-to-fix-broken-access-control/"&gt;Broken authentication&lt;/a&gt; could lead to data exposure, unintended function triggers, and even server actions such as deletion or modification. This kind of attack could be combined with other vectors to result in denial-of-service attacks, logic damage, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust authentication mechanisms are the only solution to this kind of issue. Proper authentication also means proper exposure and trust systems as well as buttressed systems supporting rate limiting, logging, and &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/securing-graphql-apis-with-identity-control/"&gt;identity and access management&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the day, the best defense is a good offense, so authentication should be planned proactively against the worst-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api03-broken-object-property-level-authorization-bopla-"&gt;API03: Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOPLA highlights the risk of users accessing specific fields of an API object they aren&amp;#8217;t authorized to view. This vulnerability combines issues like excess data exposure and mass assignment. This inadequate validation of user authorization at the property level potentially leads to unwanted data exposure or manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue can arise with improper configuration at the property level. For example, a webhook might be triggered to update or return specific fields of an object in a database. If the webhook endpoint doesn&amp;#8217;t correctly validate that the calling service is authorized to read or write those specific fields, it could result in unauthorized data exposure or manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate this problem, developers should implement stringent authorization checks for each field that a webhook can access. This means not only verifying that the calling service is authorized to access the object but also that each specific property of that object is within that access scope. Audit logs should also be maintained to record which services accessed what data to ensure long-term tracking and validity of extant data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="well"&gt;Also read: &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/apis-vs-webhooks-how-are-they-different/"&gt;APIs vs. Webhooks: How Are They Different?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api04-unrestricted-resource-consumption"&gt;API04: Unrestricted Resource Consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APIs that don&amp;#8217;t properly limit or monitor their resource consumption are vulnerable to this type of attack. Overconsumption of resources can lead to denial of service and, in long-term attacks, can heighten operational costs to a damaging level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrestricted resource consumption is an insidious threat in that it can be both an immediate threat in terms of denial of service or a long-term threat with escalating costs. When webhooks are designed to trigger automatically based on specific events without adequate rate-limiting or monitoring in place, these attacks can be exploited in a very significant way, causing extreme damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect against this issue, it&amp;#8217;s crucial to implement robust rate-limiting on webhook endpoints. This rate-limiting should be dynamic and adapt to the system&amp;#8217;s current state, becoming stricter if the system is under heavy load or potential attack. &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/20-api-monitoring-tools/"&gt;Monitoring solutions&lt;/a&gt; should be in place to detect unusual spikes in activity or resource consumption, alerting administrators to potentially malicious behavior. Employ timeouts for webhook-triggered operations to prevent any single operation from consuming too many resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api05-broken-function-level-authorization-bfla-"&gt;API05: Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BFLA occurs when users are able to execute functions they&amp;#8217;re not authorized for, like a regular user performing an admin-level task. These weaknesses in &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/how-to-control-user-identity-within-microservices/"&gt;access control policies&lt;/a&gt; lead to unauthorized access to functions as well as the underlying protected data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webhooks can be vulnerable to these kinds of attacks without an adequate functional authorization system. Suppose a webhook is designed to simply accept a function assuming a trusted resource. In that case, the function itself has no real security and can be used for various attack scenarios that could very well be extremely damaging. This is especially true when considering webhooks designed to function in a trusted environment, such as in a collection of lightweight microservices (for instance, an Internet-of-Things architecture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate this risk, always ensure that functions have &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/using-opa-for-api-authorization/"&gt;adequate authorization methodologies&lt;/a&gt;. Whether this is role-based or attribute-based, some sort of effective and audited system must implement control policies to effectively mitigate this threat. &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/10-nodejs-packages-that-you-can-use-for-api-logging/"&gt;Monitoring and logging&lt;/a&gt; continue to be necessary to detect long-term issues, but proactive management is your best friend here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api06-unrestricted-access-to-sensitive-business-flows"&gt;API06: Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of issue arises when business flows, for instance, purchasing an item, are exposed without consideration for what this means for the holistic API. The problem with this kind of flaw is that it&amp;#8217;s not necessarily a configuration error — after all, purchasing an item may indeed be the entire point of the API. We saw this kind of flaw rampant during the launch of video game consoles in the last few years, where attackers utilized an endpoint and a botnet of devices to automatically buy up the entire stock of an item for later resale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webhooks are particularly sensitive to business flow exposure due to the nature of the technology. Webhooks are meant to surface information from business flows through an &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/whats-the-difference-between-rest-and-event-driven-architecture/"&gt;event-driven architecture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best defense to this kind of attack, then, is to ensure that the business flows that are surfaced are intended to be surfaced. Auditing the series of flows and ensuring that the events triggering each webhook are correct is of vital importance. Reducing the overall events can be helpful, but a heuristics approach will be much more effective. Track abuse and overuse of each webhook endpoint to identify flows that are at high risk for abuse and then further protect those particular endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api07-server-side-request-forgery-ssrf-"&gt;API07: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSRF is when an attacker induces the server to make a request on their behalf, potentially accessing internal resources or exposing sensitive information. This potentially allows unrestricted access to critical functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server-side request forgery (SSRF) poses a unique risk to webhooks, especially those designed to interact with external services based on received payloads or commands. For instance, a webhook may be set up to fetch additional data from an internal API or database when triggered. If an attacker is able to manipulate the webhook&amp;#8217;s input parameters, they could trick the server into making unauthorized requests to internal or even external resources as a server-originated request, leading to data exposure or unauthorized actions. This kind of vulnerability effectively turns the webhook into a &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/api-gateway-best-practices-to-improve-security/"&gt;gateway&lt;/a&gt; for attackers to probe, interact with, or exploit other parts of the system or network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate these vulnerabilities, ensure strict input validation and sanitization. Limit the types of requests that can be made through the webhook to minimize the potential for abuse. Network segmentation and firewalls can also restrict which resources the server hosting the webhook can access, offering another layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api08-security-misconfiguration"&gt;API08: Security Misconfiguration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a broad category that includes mistakenly exposing sensitive information or functionalities due to misconfigurations in the server or application. At its most basic, this category can broadly be defined as flaws that let attackers force the API to make unwanted requests to external resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/beware-oauth-misconfigurations-to-protect-your-web-apis/"&gt;Security misconfiguration&lt;/a&gt; is a risk that can significantly affect any service. A common mistake is deploying a webhook with default settings for the chosen solution, which might include over-permissive access controls or exposed sensitive information. Misconfigurations can lead to various vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access and data leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent this threat, it&amp;#8217;s critical to follow a secure deployment process with webhooks specifically in mind. Ensure that only necessary webhooks exist on the stack to avoid creep in the attack surface. Utilize technologies such as heuristics to identify errant configuration abuse in production and use automated scanners and frameworks to detect misconfiguration issues in development. Regularly review and update configurations, including access control lists and rate-limiting settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api09-improper-inventory-management"&gt;API09: Improper Inventory Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is about not maintaining a &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/10-steps-to-catalog-your-growing-api-inventory/"&gt;clear inventory&lt;/a&gt; of API versions, environments, and deprecated fields. Attackers can exploit this oversight to find and exploit old or unprotected API endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given their event-driven nature, it&amp;#8217;s not uncommon for mature organizations to have multiple versions of webhooks interacting with various internal and external services. Without a &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/7-reasons-why-cataloging-your-api-inventory-matters/"&gt;well-maintained inventory&lt;/a&gt;, older webhook versions with known vulnerabilities might not get decommissioned or updated, providing an attack surface for malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve this threat, organizations should maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of all active webhook endpoints, along with the versions, environments they operate in, and the fields they use. This inventory should be regularly audited to identify and decommission outdated or unnecessary webhooks. For versioning, consider applying semantic versioning to make it easier to track changes and understand the impact of those changes. Automated tools can be employed to discover and catalog webhooks as part of the development pipeline, ensuring that the inventory stays current as changes are deployed while reducing the overhead in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="well"&gt;Also check out: &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/6-strategies-for-documenting-webhooks/"&gt;6 Strategies for Documenting Webhooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="api10-unsafe-consumption-of-apis"&gt;API10: Unsafe Consumption of APIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s essential to validate and sanitize data from third-party APIs. Treating data from external systems as trusted can introduce vulnerabilities to the system, especially when consuming these APIs without due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="webhooks-threat"&gt;Webhooks Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webhooks, like all APIs, are inherently at risk when interacting with external APIs. Any external API is outside the control of the core developer, meaning that any dependence on them, no matter how small or large, potentially opens up risks of unsafe consumption. External APIs can be taken over by malicious actors, but even &amp;#8220;safe&amp;#8221; APIs that are still under developer control can have hidden vulnerabilities and issues that spread locally when referenced by an API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your best solution to this kind of problem is to adopt a &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/understanding-the-need-for-zero-trust-architecture/"&gt;zero-trust model&lt;/a&gt;. Implement rigorous validation and sanitization procedures for any data received through webhooks, and always treat incoming data as untrusted, regardless of the source. Apply thorough &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/25-json-parsing-and-validation-tools/"&gt;input validation checks&lt;/a&gt;, including type-checks, length verification, heuristic analysis, format validation, and sanitation. Utilize automated security tools that can scan incoming payloads for known vulnerabilities or malicious patterns. Treat all incoming data as if it could cause incredible damage, because the reality is that it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this gives you a solid base from which webhook vulnerabilities can begin to be addressed. No security posture is ever going to be perfect, but covering the most common vulnerabilities will deliver a more robust service.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Is DX Different Than UX?</title>
      <link>https://nordicapis.com/how-is-dx-different-than-ux/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=how-is-dx-different-than-ux</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech writing can be full of more lingo than an insurance convention. It can feel impossible to decipher, let alone master each micro-discipline. DX and UX, which stand for developer experience and user experience, respectively, are particularly impenetrable, as two small letters don&amp;#8217;t even give enough context to offer insight into how they can literally make or break a tech product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s start with some definitions. Understanding what DX and UX &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; will help to dispel any confusion. Then we&amp;#8217;ll wrap up with a side-by-side comparison, which should answer &amp;#8220;how is DX different than UX?&amp;#8221; once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-dx-"&gt;What Is DX?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/what-is-developer-experience/"&gt;what is DX?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; is particularly thorny, which is part of why answering the &amp;#8220;how is DX different than UX?&amp;#8221; question is so confusing. It requires some disambiguation, as several acronyms use the same abbreviation. In our context, it doesn&amp;#8217;t mean &amp;#8216;mod X,&amp;#8217; which is how DX is used in math. It&amp;#8217;s not &amp;#8216;digital experience,&amp;#8217; either, although that&amp;#8217;s closer to the meaning you&amp;#8217;ll likely encounter when reading about APIs and API-consuming products. It&amp;#8217;s not digital transformation, either, although focusing on developer experience can help create a transition to digital business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers and programmers that use their APIs, DX stands for &amp;#8216;developer experience.&amp;#8217; Developer experience refers to the developer&amp;#8217;s journey with a piece of software and the degree of friction they experience while using it. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/developer-experience/"&gt;defines developer experience as&lt;/a&gt; as &amp;#8220;how easy or how difficult it is to perform essential tasks to implement a change.&amp;#8221; They break DX down into four main stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build&lt;/strong&gt;: Verifies that changes are error-free and can be compiled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test&lt;/strong&gt;: Verifies that all automated tests can be passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensures every component can be launched via simulated execution in a deployed environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debug&lt;/strong&gt;: Includes a tool for detecting and correcting any errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s definition of developer experience is adequate for a general understanding of DX. Yet, API developers and consumers have specialized needs, which means &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/why-api-developer-experience-matters-more-than-ever/"&gt;API developer experience&lt;/a&gt; deserves its own explanation. NGINX &lt;a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/why-the-api-developer-experience-matters/"&gt;defines API developer experience as&lt;/a&gt; as &amp;#8220;the overall perceptions and emotions a developer has while interacting with an API.&amp;#8221; They list infrastructure, tools, processes, and support as key components to API developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="well"&gt;Also read: &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/7-ways-to-improve-your-documentation-developer-experience/"&gt;7 Ways to Improve Your Documentation Developer Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-ux-"&gt;What Is UX?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#8217;s take a quick look at UX to better understand the difference between UX and DX. UX stands for user experience, which &lt;a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/"&gt;Nieman Group defines as&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;all aspects of the end-user&amp;#8217;s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User experience takes every aspect of an end-user&amp;#8217;s interaction with a product or service into account. Everything from the user interface (UI) to the backend performance and marketing materials play a part in UX. For a product to offer exceptional UX, information architect Peter Morville talks about the &lt;a href="https://semanticstudios.com/user_experience_design/"&gt;UX Honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;. According to the UX Honeycomb, a product should meet seven criteria to deliver exceptional UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_18123" style="width: 450px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The user experience honeycomb." class="size-full wp-image-18123" height="440" src="https://nordicapis.com/wp-content/uploads/User-experience-honeycomb.jpg" width="440" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-18123"&gt;The UX Honeycomb. Image credit: &lt;a href="https://semanticstudios.com/"&gt;@semanticstudios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-is-dx-different-than-ux-"&gt;How Is DX Different Than UX?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, DX is a specialized branch of UX. If UX is the genus, DX is the species, with its own unique strengths, weaknesses, and needs. With that being said, DX and UX are intricately intertwined, as focusing on the developer&amp;#8217;s experience can also help you deliver superior end-user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some regards, DX is &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; demanding that UX, though. Developers have much more demanding requirements and rigorous standards, for one thing. &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/6-techniques-99-999-uptime/"&gt;99.999% uptime&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, is even more important for developers than general users since they depend on your API to power their own products and tools and integrate with other applications. You need to keep all of these things in mind when dealing with DX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, you can&amp;#8217;t slack on either UX &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; DX. General design principles, like those laid out &lt;a href="https://principles.design/examples/amp-design-principles"&gt;by AMP&lt;/a&gt;, state the order of importance to be &amp;#8216;User Experience =&amp;gt; Developer Experience =&amp;gt; Ease of Implementation.&amp;#8217; That&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s important to distinguish who will be consuming your service. In the case of &lt;a&gt;API products&lt;/a&gt;, developers &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the users, so the two terms are essentially synonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-to-improve-developer-experience"&gt;Ways to Improve Developer Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating materials specifically for developers lets you assume a higher level of technical proficiency than if you&amp;#8217;re creating products for a general audience. Creating onboarding materials that take brand-new users with zero tech experience to high-level data scientists, analysts, information architects, and developers with years of experience is incredibly challenging. Although you don&amp;#8217;t want to get &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; complicated, it should be safe to assume that developers working with your API will have a higher level of technical proficiency than someone picking up a smartphone for the first time or sending their first HTTP query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly differentiate how DX is different than UX, it&amp;#8217;s useful to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/why-your-api-needs-a-dedicated-developer-experience-team/"&gt;listen to that specific audience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Spend some time where your core user base is hanging out, like GitHub, for example. Ask specific questions, like what languages they&amp;#8217;re using, what &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/10-best-practices-for-sdk-generation/"&gt;libraries they&amp;#8217;d like to see&lt;/a&gt;, what integrations they&amp;#8217;d find particularly useful, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to another core difference between UX and DX: developers are more likely to be using multiple environments. If you&amp;#8217;re creating tools for developers, it&amp;#8217;s a good idea to &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/how-sdks-benefit-api-developer-experience/"&gt;include SDKs&lt;/a&gt; and code samples for the most popular programming languages and development environments. You might also consider creating tools and resources for &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/helpful-api-developer-experience-dx-tools/"&gt;popular development and testing environments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering there are &lt;a href="https://blog.postman.com/celebrating-20-million-postman-users/"&gt;over 20 million Postman users&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a safe bet that it&amp;#8217;d be worth your time to create a Postman collection to help developers effortlessly integrate your API. You might ask about how they intend to use your API, as well. If you know how developers plan to use your API, you can &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/7-best-practices-for-api-sandboxes/"&gt;create demos&lt;/a&gt; to showcase your API in action in helpful ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to another distinction. It&amp;#8217;s even more important to facilitate a &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/tips-building-developer-community/"&gt;healthy community&lt;/a&gt; for developers using your API. It needs to be &lt;em&gt;as easy as possible&lt;/em&gt; for developers to report bugs or ask for features they&amp;#8217;d like to see. It&amp;#8217;s also important to respond to concerns and requests as quickly as possible when dealing with DX. While listening to customers is always important, it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; important with DX. As developers are creating their own tools and products that use your API, there&amp;#8217;s likely more money on the line than with individual users. Every developer potentially represents a major revenue stream. Respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="well"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/how-to-measure-and-improve-internal-developer-experience/"&gt;How to Measure and Improve Internal Developer Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts-on-dx-vs-ux"&gt;Final Thoughts On DX Vs. UX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, DX and UX are like squares and rectangles. Every square is a rectangle, but not every rectangle is a square. In other words, DX &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; UX, but it&amp;#8217;s a highly specialized form of UX with its unique demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, it&amp;#8217;s safe to assume that developers using your API will likely be more technically savvy than if you were designing products for a general audience. It should be safe to use slightly more advanced language in your onboarding materials. Instead of creating tutorials for every experience level, you can focus on making your &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/8-developer-portal-best-practices/"&gt;onboarding materials&lt;/a&gt; even more targeted, usable, and valuable. You want developers to be able to get up and running with your API as quickly as possible. The slightest stumble could cause them to look elsewhere, losing you a valuable long-term customer in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/how-is-dx-different-than-ux/"&gt;How Is DX Different Than UX?&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com"&gt;Nordic APIs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A conditional statement represents a branch in our code. A place where things could go one way, or they could go the other. That, at least, is traditionally what they are. &lt;strong&gt;Adam&lt;/strong&gt;'s co-worker took a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; user:
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; user.is_owner():
        self.template_values[&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;'login_url'&lt;/span&gt;] = users.create_login_url(self.request.uri)
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;:
        self.template_values[&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;'login_url'&lt;/span&gt;] = users.create_login_url(self.request.uri)
&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;:
    self.template_values[&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;'login_url'&lt;/span&gt;] = users.create_login_url(self.request.uri)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of Python code, we start with a null check- if &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; is not null, we check if they're an owner. Whether they are, or not, or whether the &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; variable is null, or not, we do the same thing in every case: set a &lt;code&gt;login_url&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam is on "code maintenance" duties, and is afraid that he'll have plenty of maintenance work going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: I know using a dictionary to communicate between code and an HTML template is a common web dev thing, but it's always a code smell to me --&gt;&lt;div&gt;

      <title>Unlocking Your Black Friday Potential: 7 Ideas to Make Every Day Count</title>
      <link>https://www.hostinger.com/blog/black-friday-ideas</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Black Friday&amp;#8217;s just around the corner, and it&amp;#8217;s not just any shopping day – it&amp;#8217;s like the Super Bowl for online shopping. eCommerce businesses have the perfect chance to engage with customers, boost brand awareness, and seriously ramp up sales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, let’s make every moment count with some stellar moves to make your &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/black-friday-marketing" rel="follow"&gt;Black Friday marketing&lt;/a&gt; campaign successful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve prepared seven creative Black Friday marketing ideas, one for each day of the week leading up to the big day. Each idea is designed to capture attention while converting that interest into more sales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Get ready to transform your Black Friday game!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.hostinger.com/tutorials/pdf/Black-Friday-Preparation-Calendar-2.pdf" rel="follow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-5817" height="283" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/BF-Prep-Calendar_in-text-banner-1024x283.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-arrange-multiple-black-friday-deals"&gt;1. Arrange Multiple Black Friday Deals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of just one deal on Black Friday, surprise your customers with multiple deals throughout the day. Schedule one for the morning and another for the evening, or even space them out by an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See below how bag brand &lt;a href="https://www.calpaktravel.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Calpak&lt;/a&gt; offers four new discounts daily during their Black Friday sales period. You can adapt this strategy by applying it on one of the days leading up to the main Black Friday event.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Calpak's Black Friday campaign that offers multiple deals in a day" class="wp-image-5795" height="524" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/calpaktravelcom-black-friday-1024x524.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Add a countdown timer to crank up the urgency and trigger FOMO. It’s like saying, &amp;#8216;Stick with us – we’ve got surprises all day long!&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This keeps your customers hooked and coming back for more. It&amp;#8217;s not just about a sale, it&amp;#8217;s about creating a shopping party they don’t want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-create-irresistible-bundles"&gt;2. Create Irresistible Bundles&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ever bought a burger and thought, &amp;#8216;Fries would be nice with this&amp;#8217;? That&amp;#8217;s basically the definition of a bundle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Say a customer grabs a winter coat from your store. They don’t know your shop also sells mittens that match the coat. Seize this opportunity by nudging them towards the mittens by offering them as a bundle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people don’t realize what they want or need unless they see it. It’s all about making shopping easier and more fun for them, and it’s great for your sales too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Check out how kitchenware brand &lt;a href="https://fromourplace.com/collections/black-friday-sale" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Our Place&lt;/a&gt; offers bundles for its Black Friday deals. It displays the amount of money the customer will save by buying these bundles, showing how valuable these discounts are.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Our Place's Black Friday bundle deals" class="wp-image-5796" height="545" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/fromourplacecom-black-friday-bundles-1024x545.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bundling your products at a discounted rate does more than simply boost your Black Friday sales. It inspires customers, showing them how different items or stacks of services can complement each other or form a more complete experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This way, you&amp;#8217;re not just moving inventory but building a more engaged community and opening the door for future upsells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-add-playful-sparks"&gt;3. Add Playful Sparks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having a website with healthy traffic is good, but what really counts is customer engagement. One fun way to get your customers to engage more deeply with your site is to gamify the shopping experience. Adding game-like elements can make clicking through your CTAs and exploring your pages more entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Picture this: a visitor lands on your site, and a well-designed pop-up appears offering a spin on a lucky wheel for a sweet discount, or a choice among hidden boxes for a gift card. It’s fun, it’s engaging, and it makes your store memorable. See the example of a lucky wheel by sustainable jewelry brand &lt;a href="https://www.analuisa.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Ana Luisa&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ana Luisa's Black Friday lucky wheel" class="wp-image-5797" height="540" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/analuisacom-gamified-element-1024x540.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Just make sure the game-like element matches the vibe of your site. Jarring or out-of-place elements could make visitors skeptical, interpreting them as spam rather than an engaging experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a crowded digital space, sometimes it&amp;#8217;s the small, fun interactions that keep people coming back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-unlock-the-power-of-referral-rewards"&gt;4. Unlock the Power of Referral Rewards&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how to turn your one-time shoppers into brand ambassadors? Referral discounts can be the key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/referral-program" rel="follow"&gt;referral program&lt;/a&gt; is a structured way to encourage existing customers to promote your business by referring to potential customers. Word-of-mouth promotion like this is a win-win solution – your existing customers feel valued, and new ones get a warm welcome with special deals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To apply this method during the Black Friday season, you can offer current customers a higher-than-usual referral bonus and provide the new customers they bring in with exclusive deals. This is especially suitable if your business already has a referral program – this way, you can differentiate this special deal from the regular one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the info about your referral deal is effortlessly shareable across social media platforms and messaging apps that your customer base uses most. Make it simple and rewarding, then watch your community grow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-offer-free-shipping"&gt;5. Offer Free Shipping&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a no-brainer: offer free shipping. Shipping fee is often considered a dealbreaker, so offering it for free will help reduce your cart abandonment rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Free shipping can be an investment that goes beyond immediate sales boosts. It&amp;#8217;s a long-term game plan that cultivates customer loyalty. This fosters a positive online shopping experience, encouraging repeat purchases and generating good word-of-mouth, which is invaluable in the crowded eCommerce landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to offering free shipping and want to apply this strategy during this shopping season, try announcing a Free Shipping Day as part of your Black Friday week promotions. This single-day offer could drive a mid-week surge in sales, getting customers to act fast and complete their purchases before the big day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your business already offers free shipping on a daily basis, you can provide faster shipping just for this day. For example, the bedding brand &lt;a href="https://www.sienasleep.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Siena&lt;/a&gt; promises to deliver your order in one to three days for its Black Friday offer instead of the regular two to five-day period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Siena's Black Friday faster free shipping promo" class="wp-image-5798" height="460" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/sienasleepcom-black-friday-min-1024x460.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember that this type of deal shouldn’t harm your profitability. Apply the best practices in offering free shipping, such as setting a minimum purchase requirement, limiting the free shipping offer to specific items, and adding shipping costs into the initial pricing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-craft-non-discount-incentives"&gt;6. Craft Non-Discount Incentives&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Black Friday is synonymous with offering deals, gifts, and special offers. These are the go-to tactics to draw customers in. In a sea of discounts, stand out by providing unique value beyond typical online sales incentives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are some Black Friday marketing ideas of non-discount incentives you can give your customers:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branded Black Friday exclusive merchandise&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Service tier upgrade&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Free samples&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Surprise gift with purchase (GWP)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Early access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, integrating a charitable component where a portion of sales is donated to a worthy cause, like helping animals or fighting world hunger, can resonate deeply with customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-extend-the-black-friday-period"&gt;7. Extend the Black Friday Period&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Black Friday is always followed by Cyber Monday. While the Black Friday shopping frenzy can happen on offline and online stores, Cyber Monday is almost exclusively online. So, it’s time for online businesses to benefit from this shopping event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keep the shopping momentum going by extending your offers for two days – the entire Black Friday weekend. This way, you’re giving shoppers a second chance to grab the &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/best-black-friday-deals" rel="follow"&gt;best Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; they intended to snatch up, enabling you to gain more conversions and laying the groundwork for Cyber Monday sales. It’s like an encore at the end of an outstanding performance, leaving your audience delighted and longing for more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider sending out an email the morning after Black Friday, letting customers know that the promotions are being extended as a gesture of gratitude for their enthusiastic participation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, be sure to imply that this extension isn&amp;#8217;t a regular occurrence, adding a touch of exclusivity to the offer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-week-in-review"&gt;The Week in Review&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an online business owner or a marketing professional, it’s your time to shine. Explore our &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/black-friday-web-hosting-deals" rel="follow"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday web hosting deals&lt;/a&gt; to make sure your online store can handle the traffic surge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once done, &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/how-to-prepare-website-for-black-friday" rel="follow"&gt;prepare your website for Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; by infusing these seven strategies with your brand&amp;#8217;s unique touch to attract customers and keep their excitement at a fever pitch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, spread your Black Friday offers across your socials and keep your audience excited about what’s coming next. With the right moves, not just Black Friday but the entire shopping week can become a revenue-generating powerhouse for your business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve got this!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/freezolite-the-magic-gem-for-keeping-ruby-literals-safely-frozen</link>

It's seriously frustrating, and RuboCop keeps bugging me as I'm always forgetting it somewhere!“ Sounds familiar? Read on and learn about the Freezolite gem, a concoction crafted up to solve this problem by Evil ~Wizards~ Martians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;a href="https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/freezolite-the-magic-gem-for-keeping-ruby-literals-safely-frozen"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</description>

      <title>The effects of not maintaining consistency with DynamoDB</title>
      <link>https://advancedweb.hu/the-effects-of-not-maintaining-consistency-with-dynamodb/</link>
      <description>&lt;a href="https://advancedweb.hu/the-effects-of-not-maintaining-consistency-with-dynamodb/"&gt;(Read this article on the blog)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with DynamoDB I found that one of the main challenges is how to maintain consistency when multiple processes are accessing the database. I wrote
about &lt;a href="https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-maintain-database-consistency-in-dynamodb/"&gt;different scenarios&lt;/a&gt; such as keeping accurate counts, implementing foreign keys, and enforcing state in
referenced items. All of these are taking advantage of DynamoDB’s transaction feature with conditional checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I got curious: what is the effect of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; implementing a condition check properly? Is it easy to exploit the code that fails to check a field when another
process might change the data in parallel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial intuition said that it should be fairly hard to do. DynamoDB boasts single-digit millisecond performance, so what’s the chance that I can make two
processes run at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, it’s quite easy to trigger an inconsistent condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="test-setup"&gt;Test setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose the textbook example of race conditions: applying a coupon multiple times. While it sounds blatant, a similar problem &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305135801/http://flexcoin.com/"&gt;took down a Bitcoin
exchange&lt;/a&gt; and is actually a problem that &lt;a href="https://vladmihalcea.com/race-condition/"&gt;affects SQL databases as
well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I have a table with a coupon code and whether it has been used or not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="plantuml"&gt;&lt;img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/9463221e2427b935514031317e8951382f2b0613e30786d436fc07bae7326b59.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API has an endpoint to apply a coupon: &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;/apply/&amp;lt;coupon&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This gives back a 200 response if the coupon was applied, 400 if not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For repeated testing, there is also an endpoint to create new coupons: &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;/create&lt;/code&gt;. This creates a new item in the table and returns the generated value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="applying-the-coupon"&gt;Applying the coupon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apply code is straightforward: it first gets the current value, checks if the coupon is still valid, then sets its &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;used&lt;/code&gt; status:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dynamodb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetItemCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="na"&gt;TableName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="na"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="na"&gt;coupon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class="na"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coupon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BOOL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dynamodb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UpdateItemCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="na"&gt;TableName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="na"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class="na"&gt;coupon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coupon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="na"&gt;UpdateExpression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;SET #used = :used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExpressionAttributeNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExpressionAttributeValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;BOOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="na"&gt;statusCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="na"&gt;statusCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tester"&gt;Tester&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tester code creates a coupon using the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;/create&lt;/code&gt; endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createRes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;create/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createRes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createRes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;couponValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createRes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;coupon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then using 3 concurrent requests it tries to apply the same value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;applyRes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;apply/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;couponValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;applyRes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By seeing how many of the three values are &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; we can see whether the coupon was applied or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this very simple setup I could replicate multiple uses 4 out of 10 times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fix"&gt;Fix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix is rather simple after the root cause is identified: add a condition that only sets the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;used&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if its current value is &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
DynamoDB guarantees that the check and the set will be done atomically so that no coupon will be applied twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;UpdateItem&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dynamodb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UpdateItemCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="na"&gt;TableName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="na"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="na"&gt;coupon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coupon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="na"&gt;UpdateExpression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;SET #used = :used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExpressionAttributeNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExpressionAttributeValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;BOOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;BOOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="na"&gt;ConditionExpression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#used = :false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this change, the results show consistency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

      <title>Run Cypress Specs In Parallel For Free Using Spec Timings</title>
      <link>https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-parallel-free-based-on-timings/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Cypress-the-company blocked projects that use 3rd party dashboard plugins like &lt;code&gt;sorry-cypress&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cypress blocked 3rd party dashboard plugins" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/blocked.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details see &lt;a href="https://currents.dev/posts/v13-blocking"&gt;Cypress.io Blocking of Sorry Cypress and Currents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="free-solution-is-available"&gt;Free solution is available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to split your multiple specs across multiple machines for free, I have created &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split"&gt;cypress-split&lt;/a&gt; plugin and described how to &lt;a href="https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-parallel-free/" title="Run Cypress Specs In Parallel For Free"&gt;Run Cypress Specs In Parallel For Free&lt;/a&gt;. This solution does not &amp;quot;mimic&amp;quot; the Cypress Cloud API, thus it should not be banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;☢️ If Cypress team DOES block &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split"&gt;cypress-split&lt;/a&gt; plugin, then I will have no choice but to block all my Cypress plugins (I have written 75+ Cypress plugins) if Cypress is run with &lt;code&gt;--record&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All we need to do to use this plugin is to add it to the &lt;code&gt;setupNodeEvents&lt;/code&gt; callback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight js"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;cypress.config.mjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#123; defineConfig &amp;#125; &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#x27;cypress&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; cypressSplit &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#x27;cypress-split&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="variable language_"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="property"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="title function_"&gt;defineConfig&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;e2e&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// baseUrl, etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;supportFile&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="literal"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;fixturesFolder&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="literal"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="title function_"&gt;setupNodeEvents&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="params"&gt;on, config&lt;/span&gt;) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;      &lt;span class="title function_"&gt;cypressSplit&lt;/span&gt;(on, config)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;      &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// IMPORTANT: return the config object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;      &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &amp;#125;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &amp;#125;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&amp;#125;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specs were split purely based on their names in the list, which can create unbalanced lists for machines. For example, let's take a project with five specs split across two machines. The first run splits the specs alphabetically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alphabetical spec timings on two machines" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/t1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is our GitHub Actions workflow file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/ci.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;

In this examples I am using version v1 the &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ughh, there is a spec &lt;code&gt;spec-d.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; that is much longer than others, and it makes the second machine take much longer. While the second machine is running &lt;code&gt;spec-d.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;spec-e.cy.js&lt;/code&gt;, the first machine is idle. It would be better to shift the spec &lt;code&gt;spec-e.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; to the first machine. Then we would save 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="timings"&gt;Timings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's tell &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; to split specs based on previous run timings. Unfortunately, we do not have 3rd party service to keep track of spec timings, thus we need to do it ourselves. Let's set another environment variable &lt;code&gt;SPLIT_FILE&lt;/code&gt; on the test runners. Right now, it points at a non-existent file &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; in the root folder of the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/ci.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="string"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="bullet"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;Cypress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;tests&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;🧪&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;# https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;uses:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;cypress-io/github-action@v6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;with:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;# we don&amp;#x27;t need Cypress own runner summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;publish-summary:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="literal"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;  &lt;span class="attr"&gt;env:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;SPLIT:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;$&amp;#123;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;strategy.job-total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;SPLIT_INDEX:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;$&amp;#123;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;strategy.job-index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;    &lt;span class="attr"&gt;SPLIT_FILE:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="string"&gt;&amp;#x27;timings.json&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's run the workflow again. The &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; file is not found yet, no big deal.

splits the specs based on durations. The first machine runs only the spec &lt;code&gt;cypress/e2e/spec-d.cy.js&lt;/code&gt; which takes by itself 60 seconds. The second machine runs the rest of the specs that together take up 40 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Specs split based on timings" src="https://glebbahmutov.com/images/split-time/t4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice. The spec split implementation can be found in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split/blob/main/src/timings.js"&gt;src&amp;#x2f;timings.js&lt;/a&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; plugin. Right now it is a simple greedy algorithm, but it seems to work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="updating-timingsjson-file-single-ci-job"&gt;Updating timings.json file: single CI job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If specs change or new specs are added, the timings file becomes out-of-date. I have a couple of ideas how to update it periodically without relying on 3rd party service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; if the spec is new and does not have duration in the timings file yet, the split algorithm assigns it an average duration of all existing specs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first strategy is to use a single long CI job that runs all specs and then commits the updated &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; file. It is very easy to commit changed files when using GitHub Actions CI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/nightly.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;

If there are any changes to the timings, the &lt;code&gt;timings.json&lt;/code&gt; file is committed and pushed to the repository using the wonderful reusable GitHub Action &lt;a href="https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action"&gt;stefanzweifel&amp;#x2f;git-auto-commit-action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; writes new timings file only if there are new specs or any durations are off by more than 10% from the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id="updating-timingsjson-file-merge-timings"&gt;Updating timings.json file: merge timings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of running a single job with all specs to update the timings file, we can use my &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; workflow from &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows"&gt;cypress-workflows&lt;/a&gt; repo. It works with &lt;code&gt;cypress-split&lt;/code&gt; alias &lt;code&gt;cypress-split-merge&lt;/code&gt; to merge downloaded timings files from parallel runs and output a single combined JSON as a GitHub Actions output. Here is an example workflow from &lt;a href="https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split-timings-example"&gt;cypress-split-timings-example&lt;/a&gt; repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="highlight yml"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;.github/workflows/split.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="attr"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;

**总结：**
文章讨论了API商业化的潜力和怎样实现API的商业化。作者强调了选择合适的商业化模式和构建适当的技术栈的重要性。对于商业化模式的选择，作者建议提供多种模式，并根据API的功能和特点确定最佳模式。文章还提到了构建API商业化技术栈所需考虑的操作流程和最佳实践。最后，作者希望读者能从他的演讲中获得关于API商业化的基础知识和技术考虑，以帮助他们有效实现API的商业化。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#8217;ve previously covered, APIs have much &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/planning-for-success-with-an-api-as-a-product-approach/"&gt;productization potential&lt;/a&gt;. But how exactly should these services be &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/self-service-is-key-for-api-monetization/"&gt;monetized&lt;/a&gt;? There is an emerging art around knowing how to charge for API calls and how to construct a viable, scalable operational process to support the API business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_16975" style="width: 190px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Matt-Tanner-Moesif" class=" wp-image-16975" height="180" src="https://nordicapis.com/wp-content/uploads/Matt-Tanner-Moesif.jpeg" width="180" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-16975"&gt;At Platform Summit 2023, Matt Tanner will dive deep into strategies for building your API monetization stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/speakers/matt-tanner/"&gt;Matt Tanner&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Developer Relations at Moesif, many companies are seeking to drive more revenue amid a slimmer economy and are turning to APIs as a new avenue for growth. Monetizing valuable proprietary services and data, for instance, is an exciting frontier, but it requires the &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/10-helpful-api-monetization-tools/"&gt;right technology stack&lt;/a&gt; to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/events/platform-summit-2023/"&gt;Platform Summit 2023&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;re chatting with key speakers to learn what they&amp;#8217;re working on and to get more background on their upcoming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt has worked as a developer, tech lead, and architect for some of Canada&amp;#8217;s largest financial institutions and insurers. At Moesif, he&amp;#8217;s been helping developers and product managers understand and use API analytics and new monetization tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up with Matt to dig into API monetization, the theme of his upcoming deep dive on &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/sessions/deep-dive-building-an-api-monetization-stack/"&gt;building an API monetization stack&lt;/a&gt; — a presentation built on two years of working heavily within the API monetization space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for the interview with Matt below, and be sure to attend the &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/events/platform-summit-2023/"&gt;Platform Summit 2023&lt;/a&gt; for more discussion on this topic and plenty of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is API monetization trending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many businesses are now realizing that APIs have a default ability to create a new stream of revenue. Especially with the current state of the economy here in the US and Canada, organizations are looking for any place possible to drive revenue. Certain technologies have also recently emerged which allow API monetization to be implemented more easily. This means that businesses considering it on their 3-5-year roadmap can now implement it much more quickly. This is a key driver I&amp;#8217;ve seen as well that has led to this uptick in API monetization popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What types of APIs can or should be monetized?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two factors to consider: does the API deliver a valuable service, and are people willing to pay for that? A good example I like to use is for a credit score API. Let&amp;#8217;s say I&amp;#8217;m a fintech company, and I have built an API that can query multiple credit bureaus and aggregate an overall credit score. This API&amp;#8217;s value proposition is that it can retrieve a credit score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question is, &amp;#8220;Do other businesses also need this?&amp;#8221;. In this case, the answer is absolutely! So, this would be a good example of an easily monetizable API (a term I have apparently just made up). Most companies have a really good idea of their most valuable proprietary APIs — they just need to ask who else may be willing to pay to use that service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should prospective API providers consider when choosing their monetization model? (Transaction volume, reve share, data volume, user-centric, resource, etc.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think offering multiple models is the best, or at least having the capability to do so. It really depends on the overall business model. For instance, it makes sense to monetize a payment processing API based on a revenue share/percentage model, such as charging 2% per transaction. In this case, it would likely not make sense to charge per API call or per user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, understanding what the API does and the most efficient way to charge for it helps uncover which model is best. Often, the limitation on monetization comes from the technology side. An example would be if you wanted to charge based on resource usage, but your metering solution only counts per API call. Then, you&amp;#8217;ll be limited to that one model. Finding the right tech will be the biggest hurdle to actually supporting different monetization models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What goes into constructing an API monetization stack? What are the operational processes to consider?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime you build something, you always want to look at what your landscape already includes. Understand the capabilities of your API gateway (if using one), what limitations a billing provider may have, etc. Once you know what you have, you can figure out what you can build with it. That will help you establish the parameters of what&amp;#8217;s possible. In an ideal world, though, you&amp;#8217;d first come up with your exact business cases, find the tech to facilitate that functionality, and then implement it from a clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, as we know, that doesn&amp;#8217;t tend to happen. Establish what you need a system to do that will monetize your APIs, then figure out the limitations (ones you can change and those that are immovable), and then implement. It sounds pretty straightforward, but you&amp;#8217;d be surprised how many people get 90% of the way there and then realize they #1 can&amp;#8217;t use the tech they require or #2 don&amp;#8217;t realize the limitations of the tech they&amp;#8217;ve chosen to build with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any anti-patterns you&amp;#8217;ve witnessed when it comes to monetizing APIs in practice? How about best practices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I&amp;#8217;ve seen is that people tend to think of monetization in two ways. The first would be to use a subscription model, and the second is to just use a &amp;#8220;charge per API call approach&amp;#8221;. These are two ways to monetize APIs. However, they don&amp;#8217;t necessarily mean you&amp;#8217;re delivering value to a customer. And most importantly, it also may mean that you are leaving potential revenue on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with defaulting to a subscription-based model is that aligning value is hard. If I charge $5k per month for API access, regardless of how many API calls or resources are used, then those making the most use of the service will likely be getting the highest while those making the least use will see a major value discrepancy. Tiers can help to offset this disparity but still leave a value gap most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A way around this is to charge based on usage, particularly per API call. With usage-based pricing, you can get closer to equal value by charging for exact use. The issue is that not every API call is equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to our payment processing API example, if I process a $2 payment through the API vs a $2000 payment, but I&amp;#8217;m paying the same amount per API call/transaction, the API call for the lower amount may have a value issue that pops up. If the price per API call was $1, then they are looking at a 50% fee versus a $1 charge against the $2000 payment, where the fee is substantially lower compared to the amount of money transacted. In this case, you&amp;#8217;d want to pick the model that is fair to customers and drives the most revenue internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For best practices, putting my software architect hat on, I suggest questioning every single scenario and mapping out edge cases. Most platforms that help with monetization can do the simple stuff well, but the edge cases become infinitely more complex to handle correctly. Since every API monetization initiative will be pretty custom, good planning is the key to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you looking forward to the Platform Summit 2023?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very excited to see the different opinions and folks within the API community. I&amp;#8217;m also excited on a personal level to visit Sweden for the first time. I think the collective knowledge that will be at this conference will give me some great insights, and I&amp;#8217;m also excited to share my knowledge with others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope attendees will take away from your talk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope attendees will see that API monetization is hard but worth it. Many companies I talk to struggle to figure out where to start. This talk will give them a solid foundation of the business fundamentals and all of the technical considerations. Hopefully, our learnings at Moesif over the last two years will benefit others as they strive to monetize their APIs effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CodeSOD: Taking the Temperature</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/taking-the-temperature</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. TA&lt;/strong&gt; inherited some C# code that communicates with a humidity and a temperature sensor. Each sensor logs a series of datapoints as they run, and can provide them as an array of data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;DataPoint[] humidDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-literal"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;;  
DataPoint[] tempDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-literal"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// For now,  determine if this is the primary or secondary sensor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (sensorType == (&lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;)SensorTypeID.HUMIDITY)
{
    &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// create the array size then get the data&lt;/span&gt;
    humidDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataPoint[ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().Count];
    humidDataPointArray = ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().ToArray();
}
&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
{
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (sensorNum == &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
    {
        &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// create the array size then get the data&lt;/span&gt;
        tempDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataPoint[((SingleSensorTemptale)ttData).PrimarySensorData.GetDataPoints().Count];
        tempDataPointArray = ((SingleSensorTemptale)ttData).PrimarySensorData.GetDataPoints().ToArray();
    }
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    {
        &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;// create the array size then get the data&lt;/span&gt;
        tempDataPointArray = &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataPoint[ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().Count];
        tempDataPointArray = ttPlusData.SecondarySensorData.GetDataPoints().ToArray();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts out okay. We create the arrays to hold the data. Then we check the &lt;code&gt;sensorType&lt;/code&gt; against an enum. And that's where things start to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initialize an empty array that's the same size as the number of data points, then we set that array equal to the array of data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm stuck trying to figure out if this is someone with no real experience, or a C programmer trying to migrate from pointers to references. Since C# is uses references, we don't need that &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;- we can just set &lt;code&gt;humidPointsArray&lt;/code&gt; equal to the result of the function call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the result of the function call- it looks like &lt;code&gt;GetDataPoints()&lt;/code&gt; returns a C# enumerable type. Which implies there's really no good reason to convert it into an array. I can't be certain about that, maybe they really need the array, but I suspect that's not the case- and it's a best practice in C# to use more abstract interfaces for collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; inside of it, instead of an &lt;code&gt;else if&lt;/code&gt;. This second condition eschews the lovely enum we used before, and just checks &lt;code&gt;sensorNum == 1&lt;/code&gt;. Then we repeat the same unnecessary allocation, with the bonus misspelling of &lt;code&gt;SingleSensorTemptale&lt;/code&gt;, which is certain never to give any future developer problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a bonus, this code runs in a tight loop, ensuring the garbage collector gets lots of practice cleaning up memory we never needed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: Honestly, it's the switch from enum to not enum that bothers me the most --&gt;

      <title>CDKTF 0.19 adds support for config-driven import and refactoring</title>
      <link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cdktf-0-19-adds-support-for-config-driven-import-and-refactoring</link>
      <description>**关键词：**
- CDK for Terraform (CDKTF)
- config-driven import
- refactoring
- resource migration
- Terraform

**大纲：**
1. CDKTF (CDK for Terraform)简介和目标
2. CDKTF的新功能：支持config-driven import和refactoring
    - 介绍CDKTF v0.19版本的发布
    - config-driven import的两种工作流程
    - refactoring中的resource移动支持
3. 如何尝试CDK for Terraform

**总结：**
CDK for Terraform (CDKTF)旨在简化Terraform的使用，通过支持多种编程语言的配置编写和引入新的功能来实现这一目标。最新版本的CDKTF (CDKTF v0.19)改进了支持config-driven import和refactoring的能力，使得开发人员可以安全地将现有基础架构引入CDKTF项目中，并进行重构操作。通过使用CDKTF，开发人员可以更方便地迁移和管理资源，而不会影响业务连续性。如果想尝试CDK for Terraform，可以查看CDKTF的教程，深入了解CDKTF的文档，并通过讨论论坛与其他用户交流。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mission of CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) is to simplify Terraform adoption. We introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cdk-for-terraform-now-generally-available"&gt;generally available version of CDKTF&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2022,  enabling developers not familiar with HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to write Terraform configurations in their choice of language, including TypeScript, Python, C#, Java, and Go. In July of 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/new-multi-language-docs-simplify-cdk-for-terraform-adoption"&gt;multi-language provider documentation for CDKTF&lt;/a&gt; further simplified infrastructure provisioning by offering provider configuration options and code samples for the programming languages supported by CDKTF, alongside the HCL documentation in the registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working to make CDKTF more powerful by supporting new Terraform features to achieve cost savings and improve security. Up until now, CDKTF had limited support for import and moved blocks, resulting in manual, cumbersome resource migration and refactoring within a CDKTF project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re releasing CDKTF version 0.19, which improves support for &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-5-brings-config-driven-import-and-checks"&gt;config-driven import&lt;/a&gt; and refactoring. This support allows developers to safely move resources and bring existing infrastructure into CDKTF projects with auto-generated code — without jeopardizing business continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Config-driven import support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importing existing infrastructure into a CDKTF project was a manual process until &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-5-brings-config-driven-import-and-checks"&gt;Terraform 1.5 introduced config-driven import&lt;/a&gt; in June. CDKTF v0.19 adds &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf/concepts/resources#importing-resources"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; for config-driven import (which requires Terraform 1.5+) with two workflows, described below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Specify a CDKTF config for a resource and specify where it is currently living:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instantiate an instance of the resource type you want to import, with an empty configuration. Then call the &lt;code&gt;importFrom&lt;/code&gt; method on the resource object, providing the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; present for the resource in the cloud provider:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new S3Bucket(this, "bucket", {}).importFrom("id-in-cloud-provider")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;When running a &lt;code&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;, you will get a message saying that your resource is going to be imported. Once you run &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;, you can remove the &lt;code&gt;importFrom&lt;/code&gt; call and the resource will now be managed by CDKTF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Generate configuration for an existing resource&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to generate configuration for an imported resource, you can use the static method &lt;code&gt;generateConfigForImport&lt;/code&gt; by specifying the type of a resource and its resource ID. When you run a plan, Terraform will generate HCL config for the resource and CDKTF will convert it to your language of choice: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;S3Bucket.generateConfigForImport(this, "bucket", "id-in-cloud-provider");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Resource refactoring with moved block support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ID of a resource is changed — for example, by refactoring it into a nested construct — destroying and recreating the resource is the default behavior of Terraform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the new &lt;code&gt;moveTo&lt;/code&gt; method lets you refactor code without losing the state or destroying and recreating the resources being moved. This is especially important when working in a production environment where you might want to restructure your code but can't afford service downtime or data loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;moveTo&lt;/code&gt; function is available on all resources and is used for relocating a resource to the location specified by the string target. To set the string target for a resource, use the &lt;code&gt;addMoveTarget&lt;/code&gt; function present on the resource to move to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new S3Bucket(this, "test-bucket-move-to", {
	bucket: "move-bucket-name",
}).addMoveTarget("move-s3");

new S3Bucket(this, "test-bucket-move-from", {
	bucket: "move-bucket-name",
}).moveTo("move-s3");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try CDK for Terraform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to the project, these &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf"&gt;tutorials for CDKTF&lt;/a&gt; are the best way to get started. You can dive deeper into our documentation with this &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf"&gt;overview of CDKTF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

- 文档团队的工作过程和贡献
- 在WordCamps中的参与和贡献
- 对WordPress社区的思考和感悟

**总结：**
本文讲述了Leonardus Nugraha（Leo）是Hostinger公司WordPress类别的内容专家，他通过个人经历介绍了他是如何进入WordPress世界并成为其中文档团队的一员的。Leo对WordPress的热爱使得他不仅仅写作关于WordPress的文章，还亲自深入参与了文档团队的工作，贡献自己的力量。作为文档团队成员，Leo通过学习文档团队的GitHub问题和参与团队会议的方式，为WordPress的终端用户和开发者撰写了包括技术指南、支持指南和自定义等多个方面的文档。此外，Leo还积极参与了WordCamps活动，不仅以志愿者的身份参与其中，还担任摄影师记录活动的精彩瞬间。通过在WordPress社区中的互动和贡献，Leo体验到了全球WordPress社区的热情和活力。在他的眼中，WP社区不仅仅是一个技术平台，更是一个充满人文关怀和激情的大家庭。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/leonnugraha/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Leonardus Nugraha&lt;/a&gt;, or Leo for short, is &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/" rel="follow"&gt;Hostinger&lt;/a&gt;’s own Content Specialist for the WordPress category. Hailing from Bogor, Indonesia, which is known for its lush botanical garden, Leo is drawn to photographing his rich surroundings. But there’s also another thing he enjoys documenting – the advancements of &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-wordpress" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn how Leo entered the world of WordPress and became part of its documentation team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-into-the-business"&gt;Getting Into the Business&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo first dipped his toes into WordPress at university, where he studied business management. During the IT in Business course, he had to create an eCommerce website from scratch. Among the various &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-a-cms/" rel="follow"&gt;content management systems&lt;/a&gt; available, Leo opted for WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That was the first time I learned about website building. We found out how to get a domain and hosting, install WordPress and &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/woocommerce-tutorial" rel="follow"&gt;WooCommerce&lt;/a&gt;, add products, and integrate payment gateways. The experience introduced me to a wider WordPress ecosystem besides the WordPress.com I had known,&amp;#8221; Leo reminisces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though he drifted away from WordPress after the project, this experience came in handy when Leo joined Hostinger as a content writer in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides crafting articles about WordPress, his team uses the CMS for publishing. &amp;#8220;I had to familiarize myself with the nuances of WordPress once more, from content publishing to understanding &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/video/what-is-seo" rel="follow"&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt; intricacies,&amp;#8221; Leo adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2021, his role had evolved, focusing more on WordPress content. This propelled him to dive deeper into the platform&amp;#8217;s technicalities. “I started to learn more about WordPress customization, keeping up with new versions, and following its development,&amp;#8221; he shares.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo&amp;#8217;s educational background, which includes a Master&amp;#8217;s degree in International Business from Monash University Malaysia, also equipped him with key skills in digital marketing for his involvement in a global open-source project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In my major, there was a strong emphasis on collaboration and project management,” he says. &amp;#8220;Collaborating with diverse groups and understanding different cultures during my studies has prepared me for my journey as a content marketer and a WordPress contributor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diving-into-wordpress-documentation"&gt;Diving Into WordPress Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to create good content about a platform, you should use it. While it is true, it wasn’t enough for Leo – he went the extra mile by diving deep into the heart of WordPress and contributing to its &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Documentation team&lt;/a&gt;. His transition from a user to a contributor reflects not only his commitment, but also the open and welcoming nature of the &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wordpress" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spark for this journey was lit shortly after Leo began writing extensively about WordPress. As an open-source platform, WordPress heavily relies on its community of contributors. When the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Five for the Future&lt;/a&gt; initiative surfaced, Hostinger decided to &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/hostinger-international/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;take part in it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My manager asked me if I wanted to participate in this initiative. I was eager to contribute, and since I’m a WordPress content specialist, I naturally gravitated towards the Documentation team,&amp;#8221; Leo says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I began learning about the Documentation team from &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the Contributor Handbook&lt;/a&gt;,” Leo recalls. “It’s pretty challenging at first. But then my manager introduced me to &lt;a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/milana_cap/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Milana Cap&lt;/a&gt;, the Documentation team representative, and she guided me through it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo then took a GitHub issue to learn how to create proper documentation for the first time. It was a new document request, which he found to be enjoyable. “I loved crafting new documents. It’s somehow more exciting than doing updates,” he laughs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leonardus Nugraha and his WordPress Documentation teammates in Community Summit 2023" class="wp-image-5629" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/leo-and-documentation-team-in-community-summit-2023-1024x683.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becoming more engaged in Documentation contribution, Leo started attending the team’s weekly meetings. He’s been volunteering to facilitate the assembly from time to time. He keeps expanding his participation by constantly learning new tasks in the team, such as helping to onboard new contributors in the Documentation table during the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/contributor-day/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Contributor Day&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp US 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s fun to be at the Documentation team’s table during Contributor Day. Besides being able to work in-person with people I normally only interact with on GitHub and Slack, there are lots of cookies to try,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cookies he mentions are the Docs team’s tradition during Contributor Days – Milana brings various cookies to munch together during the event. “In the Docs team’s Slack channel, we usually give kudos – a way to say someone is doing a good job – by giving a cookie emoji. So we bring it to life during Contributor Day at our table. Of course, we share them with other teams as well,” Leo remarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And to answer a common query, Leo clarifies that one doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be a technical expert to contribute to the team. “There are two types of documentation: end-user and developer. For end-user documentation, if you use WordPress and understand its workings, you should be able to write the docs. It&amp;#8217;s basically about guiding other users to navigate inside the platform. However, creating developer documentation needs technical knowledge to a certain extent.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rolling-as-a-documentation-team-member"&gt;Rolling as a Documentation Team Member&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work of WordPress&amp;#8217;s Documentation team involves more processes than solely writing the guidance. “The Docs team aims to ensure that each feature is accurately and comprehensively explained. For example, let’s take &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wordpress-blocks" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress Blocks&lt;/a&gt;. When creating documentation about the feature, we explain what it is and detail how to use its and its features. If any visual representations are available, we will include them in the documentation, so that end-users can understand it better,” Leo explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the process to craft a documentation article that Leo usually goes through:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scour the &lt;a href="https://github.com/WordPress/documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Documentation Team GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for issues you want to work on, then assign yourself to the issue.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Start drafting. You can do it in Google Docs, or directly on the WordPress back end if you have access.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When writing, you can test the feature, but make sure to refer to the GitHub ticket that explains what the feature is.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Once the draft is ready, reviewers will step in to ensure the content aligns with style guides and formatting requirements. They will also make edits if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When it gets reviewed, the documentation can be published.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo also mentions that the Docs team regularly updates the existing documentation. “In every WordPress release, the Documentation release squad will check the existing documentation and see what updates must be made. This applies for both end-user and developer documentation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then explains that these updates usually are made during the &lt;a href="https://theproductmanager.com/topics/software-release-life-cycle/#:~:text=A%20release%20candidate%20(RC)%20is,to%20as%20%E2%80%9CControlled%20Availability%E2%80%9D." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Release Candidate&lt;/a&gt; period. There can also be updates outside the release cycle, if minor changes are applied or any errors found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for now, there are four main categories for end-user documentation on the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordPress Documentation&lt;/a&gt; website – WordPress overview, technical guides, support guides, and customization. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;developer documentation&lt;/a&gt; is categorized based on more specific topics such as code reference, plugins, and the block editor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="the homepage of WordPress Documentation website that shows user documentation" class="wp-image-5630" height="414" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/wordpress-documentation-1024x414.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that developer documentation is different from &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/writing-developer-notes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;developer notes&lt;/a&gt;. Developer documentation covers broader technical aspects of WordPress, such as the best coding practices and how to interact with various APIs. Meanwhile, a developer note contains the details of technical changes in an upcoming WordPress release, and what developers need to know about such changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Leo has never touched on developer documentation, he did work on the developer notes for &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wordpress-6-3-release-leads" rel="follow"&gt;WordPress 6.3&lt;/a&gt;. “I gathered notes about new features, code changes, and its utilization. Then I categorized them, and published them during the release cycle,&amp;#8221; he elaborates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To bring structure and direction, there’s a biweekly meeting within the Docs team. The session involves team updates, work progress, and brainstorming, while the triage meeting focuses on assigning GitHub issues to contributors. “So if there&amp;#8217;s a high priority documentation, or if there are backlogs, we just post in the triage meeting and ask who wants to work on it,” Leo explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then mentions that the Docs team also carries out an online Contributor Day every fourth week of the month. The event comes in the form of a three-hour Zoom session. Leo adds, “It’s an easy entry point for newcomers, and often includes onboarding calls in a separate break room.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-lines-behind-the-lens"&gt;Beyond the Lines, Behind the Lens&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like many WordPress enthusiasts, Leo always looks forward to attending &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/what-is-wordcamp" rel="follow"&gt;WordCamps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My first WordCamp was &lt;a href="https://gresik.wordcamp.org/2022/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp Gresik 2022&lt;/a&gt;, a local WordCamp in Indonesia. There were around 200 attendees, just one conference day and one contributor&amp;#8217;s day. It gave me the idea of what WordCamp is,” Leo recalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At WordCamp Gresik, besides attending presentations, he joined the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Polyglots Team&lt;/a&gt;’s table. “There was no Documentation table, so I thought it would be great to explore other teams,” Leo adds. He unexpectedly became a &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/about/roles-and-capabilities/#general-translation-editor" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;General Translation Editor&lt;/a&gt; there, broadening his contribution horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the things Leo loves the most about WordCamps is the opportunity to network with other WordPress enthusiasts and professionals. As a part of the Hostinger team, he also gets to interact with our &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/wordpress-hosting" rel="follow"&gt;Managed WordPress hosting&lt;/a&gt; customers. &amp;#8220;Engaging with fellow WordPress users and industry people expanded my understanding of the global WordPress community,&amp;#8221; he expresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo also enjoys volunteering for WordCamps, especially as a photographer. &amp;#8220;My first experience volunteering for WordCamp was in &lt;a href="https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WordCamp Asia 2023&lt;/a&gt;, where I volunteered as a photographer. I&amp;#8217;ve always had a &lt;a href="https://leoandlens.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;passion for photography&lt;/a&gt;, so this let me merge my hobby and contribution while enjoying the event,&amp;#8221; Leo states.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leonardus Nugraha and Indonesian WordPress community in WordCamp Asia 2023" class="wp-image-5631" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/leo-and-indonesian-wordpress-community-1024x683.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While his strong side is landscape and architecture photography, Leo is fond of capturing candid moments at WordCamps. &amp;#8220;I adore candid shots, people in spontaneous interactions. They capture the WordCamp spirit authentically,&amp;#8221; he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although not an active member of the &lt;a href="https://make.wordpress.org/photos/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Photos Team&lt;/a&gt;, Leo has made his mark by uploading some of his photo works to the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/photos/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Photo Directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on WordCamp memories, his thoughts always return to WordCamp Asia&amp;#8217;s first day. &amp;#8220;It was surreal, meeting and connecting with the global WordPress community face-to-face. These interactions, dinners, and after-parties have carved unforgettable memories,&amp;#8221; Leo concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In essence, Leo&amp;#8217;s journey in the WordPress community is not just about contributions. It&amp;#8217;s about connections, passion, and memorable moments that span across continents and pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stay Motivated When Working on a Difficult Story</title>
      <link>https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/10/17/motivated-difficult-story/</link>
      <description>**关键词**: 问题解决, 进展追踪, 工作切换, 伙伴合作, 激励方法

**大纲**:
- 追踪进展：记录工作的进展情况，避免感觉停滞不前
- 工作切换：在不同任务之间切换，避免对单一任务过度投入
- 休息放松：暂时放下长期困扰的任务，休息一天后重新开始可能有新的想法
- 伙伴合作：与其他开发人员一起工作，获得新的观点和避免枯燥感
- 寻找激励方法：通过以上方法使自己保持积极状态

**总结**:
当我们在解决一个看似轻而易举的问题时，常常会遇到困境。需求不断变化，问题复杂度超出预期，这些原因都可能让我们感到沮丧。为了保持动力，有几个方法可以尝试。首先，追踪进展，记录工作的进展情况，避免感觉停滞不前。其次，可以在不同任务之间切换，避免对单一任务过度投入，从而获得一些小的成功，恢复工作的积极性。另外，对于没有时间限制的任务，可以暂时搁置一天，然后再回来，也许会有一些新的思路。此外，可以邀请其他开发人员合作，获得新的观点和避免枯燥感。最后，寻找适合自己的激励方法，通过以上方法保持积极状态。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;It happens to all of us. We start working on a story that seems like it should be a breeze, but we quickly get a dose of reality. Maybe some requirements keep changing. Maybe there&amp;#8217;s more heavy factoring than expected. Whatever the reason, it can feel demoralizing to work on a problem that might feel ever-growing. Here are some tips to stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep track of your progress.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most demotivating parts of working on a problem that drags on is feeling like you’re not moving forward. It can feel sometimes as though success with software is defined by the number of &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/12/16/writing-good-stories/"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; completed. When one story goes on forever, it can feel like you’re not accomplishing enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the time every few hours to write a brief note about what you’ve done. Reminding yourself that you have done measurable work can help you feel less stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Switch chunks of work.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve spent a lot of time working on one chunk of the story and you’re starting to struggle (or maybe you&amp;#8217;re just getting bored). It’s okay to put your fears about &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/03/24/reduce-context-switching/"&gt;context switching&lt;/a&gt; aside and jump over to another chunk. There’s no use spinning your wheels on one subtask when you could knock out some other bits. A few small successes will also get you back into a productive mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the story you’re working on isn’t time-sensitive, it can sometimes help to take a break from it. Put the entire story on the back burner for a day. When you come back to it, you may have some fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pair frequently.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending a long time on a single piece of work can cause feelings of siloing. It can be useful to bring in other developers to work with you on a chunk of work. This has practical benefits, like new perspectives. Maybe more importantly in this situation, it helps with &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/04/11/strategies-stay-motiviated-when-bored/"&gt;boredom&lt;/a&gt;. Pairing frequently will keep you focused and moving toward finishing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Key Takeaways from #Current2023</title>
      <link>https://blog.cloudera.com/5-key-takeaways-from-current2023/</link>
      <description>**关键词**: Current 2023, Apache Flink, streaming database, Change Data Capture (CDC), tooling for Kafka ecosystem

**大纲**:

文章主要讨论了最近由Confluent举办的Current 2023（即Kafka峰会）的重要性以及会议中关键的五个观点。首先，Apache Flink被广泛认可为流处理的事实标准，其受欢迎程度逐渐接近Spark。其次，出现了一种新兴的竞争对手类型——“流数据库”，他们声称比Flink更快，并且具有更好的工具性能。接下来，Change Data Capture（CDC）的重要性逐渐凸显，Debezium成为CDC的事实标准。此外，关于Kafka生态系统的工具和工具性能有所改善，提供了更多的功能和改进的用户体验。最后，流处理技术仍有进一步发展和成熟的空间，尤其是在数据流的成熟度和实时处理方面。

**总结**: 

本文总结了Current 2023会议的关键观点，其中包括Apache Flink成为流处理的标准，出现了“流数据库”作为对Flink的替代品的新竞争对手，CDC的重要性以及Debezium在该领域的地位，工具性能的改善以及流处理技术的发展和成熟度方面的潜力。然而，尽管流处理技术的采用率不断增长，但其成熟度仍然处于早期阶段。综合而言，流处理仍有很大的发展空间，并且需要完整的工具支持。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.cloudera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1256169936-1-273x182.jpg" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Recently, Confluent hosted Current 2023 (formerly Kafka summit) in San Jose on Sept 26th and 27th. With few conferences curating content specific to streaming developers, Current has historically been an important event for anyone trying to keep a pulse on what’s happening in the streaming space.  Over 2,000 attendees and lots of new solutions were on display, and the event proved to be a clear look into the current (no pun intended) state of streaming and where it is headed. This blog is for anyone who was interested but unable to attend the conference, or anyone interested in a quick summary of what happened there. I will cover key takeaways from Current 2023 and offer Cloudera’s perspective. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Five Takeaways from Current 2023:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 1- The people have spoken and Apache Flink is the de facto standard for stream processing  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This may seem obvious to many who are already familiar with Flink, but it is worth pointing out. Architecture decisions have long-term effects and an important consideration when choosing a stream processing engine is whether the technology will stagnate or continue to evolve with contributions from the open source community. Will I be able to find developers for this three years from now? The answer from the community is a resounding yes. Flink is here to stay. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It makes perfect sense that Apache Flink has emerged as the standard. Flink was launched in 2015 as the world’s first open source streaming-first distributed stream processing engine and has since grown to rival Spark in terms of popularity. And the layered APIs from low-level operations to high-level abstractions gives Flink appeal to a broad range of users. The adoption of Flink mirrors growth in streaming data volumes and maturity of the streaming market. As organizations shift from the modernization of data-driven applications via Kafka towards delivering real-time &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;insight &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and/or powering smart automated systems, Flink &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At Current, adoption of Flink was a hot topic and many of the vendors (Cloudera included) use Flink as the engine to power their stream processing offerings as well.  Use cases such as fraud monitoring, real-time supply chain insight, IoT-enabled fleet operations, real-time customer intent, and modernizing analytics pipelines are driving development activity. The value of consolidating different processing frameworks onto a single comprehensive framework to minimize technical overhead and maintain innovation speed is well understood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The big announcement everyone was waiting for was the unveiling of Apache Flink in Confluent Cloud. The actual unveiling was a bit underwhelming as the SQL console left a lot to be desired, and outside of serverless auto-scaling functionality there was no “wow” factor. As of this writing, the product is still not GA and will not be made available on-prem, but the unveiling is still important due to the sheer size of the Confluent user base. Adoption will follow, and it’s safe to say that we have passed the tipping point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Flink is the future of streaming.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera’s perspective: Cloudera saw the increasing volumes of data our customers were moving via streams early on. They were suffering rising costs and were struggling to provide real-time insight to demanding stakeholders. So we bet big on Flink in 2020 and started developing tooling to bring it to the enterprise, and have a mature Flink product used by customers in banking, telco, manufacturing, and IT.  kSQLdb, Spark Structured Streaming, and other proprietary approaches that fall short of the truly open and distributed stateful stream processing capabilities that Flink brings to the table will likely decelerate.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2- But there is an intriguing new category of competitor emerging, the “streaming database”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There are a handful of vendors positioning streaming databases as an alternative to Flink for stream processing. Their core value proposition is that streaming databases are inherently faster than Flink due to in-memory processing and state management. This makes sense in theory, but there are pretty wild claims out there as far as just how much&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;faster they are, and with a lack of independent benchmarks in the industry a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted. But the tech is interesting and the allure of DB tooling that can “do-it-all” is strong. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera’s perspective: There is much value to be captured by bringing real-time processing capabilities to streaming architectures. Kafka-centric approaches leave a lot to be desired, most notably operational complexity and difficulty integrating batch data, so there is certainly a gap to be filled. Real-time databases have their place in the streaming ecosystem, but that place is in publishing and making the result sets widely available after a highly scalable engine like Flink has processed the data. Cloudera does this via materialized views that are accessible via API. Also, why solve for connectivity and data distribution again if it’s already solved for? How long does streaming data live inside the database and what happens when it expires? Is this yet another database? What about data lock-in? With highly interdependent capabilities, how difficult will it be to make modifications as business and data requirements evolve?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This class of technologies is very interesting, but still new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“wait and see” is perhaps sage advice.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3- Change data capture is red hot and Debezium is the de facto standard in this space &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Judging by the sheer number of questions from the audience about CDC in general and Debezium specifically, it’s safe to say that Debezium has become for CDC what Flink is for stream processing. It makes perfect sense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;similar to Flink, Debezium is an open source distributed service frequently used with Kafka to extend the value of streaming and capture new use cases. Debezium works by continuously reading the change logs of popular databases and publishing to Kafka topics, effectively transforming legacy batch systems into rich streams of data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Debezium does have certain complexities of course, namely resource management and schema evolution. But there is much value to be captured here.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera perspective: Data freshness matters. It’s difficult to imagine a use case where fresher data isn’t inherently better data. Change Data Capture is an important part of the streaming ecosystem. Cloudera supports Debezium connectors for Kconnect and Flink and will soon release a NiFi processor as well, giving users fine grain control over data distribution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4- Tooling for the Kafka ecosystem is improving &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It’s no secret that Kafka deployments can be quite complex. Setting up clusters, monitoring and managing brokers, partitions, and topics, handling message ordering, exactly once guarantees, schema evolution and security: these all add up to operational overhead. Data lineage and debugging can be a nightmare to unravel. As the streaming space grows in maturity one thing that stood out is the improved tooling in the space. Confluent’s future vision for the data portal is a great example of the effort to provide better tooling and smoother user experience around discoverability and governance. Many vendors are providing enhanced tooling to provide observability and improve performance or to extend the ecosystem by integrating other frameworks such as MQTT and Pulsar.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera perspective: Cloudera began providing support and building tooling for the Kafka ecosystem in 2015 and has developed stable enterprise solutions. The Streams Messaging Manager tool is included in our free community edition of Cloudera Streams Processing. Furthermore, Cloudera SDX provides an integrated set of security and governance tools across the entire data lifecycle, including streaming. The Kafka platform shifting from Zookeeper to Kraft as is a huge relief for anyone managing Kafka operations. KRaft is already in tech preview for our next release.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For these reasons and more, IBM recently chose Cloudera as strategic Kafka partner of choice to bring cost efficient, scalable solutions to our enterprise customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/ibm-technology-chooses-cloudera-as-its-preferred-partner-for-addressing-real-time-data-movement-using-kafka/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;https://blog.cloudera.com/ibm-technology-chooses-cloudera-as-its-preferred-partner-for-addressing-real-time-data-movement-using-kafka/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- There is still room for growth and maturation in the streaming space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;While adoption of streaming technologies has steadily increased, the average streaming maturity level is still in the early stages. Streaming maturity is not about simply streaming more data; it’s about weaving streaming data more deeply into operations to drive real-time utilization across the enterprise. The number of use cases supported by a single Kafka topic is a better indicator than a raw measure of volume like events per second. Surprisingly few users had multiple use cases for most of their Kafka topics. Another hallmark of streaming maturity is the efficiency of the entire system in terms of resource utilization and ease of developing or modifying new use cases. Real-time processing can significantly reduce the volume of data in the stream and that’s a good thing. The majority of data streamers are just beginning to experiment here.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;More forward-looking talks focused on expanding the impact of streaming data.  Real-time anomaly detection and other time series operations on event streams. Operationalizing python for real-time ML pipelines was a hot topic. Others focused on the big picture efficiency, looking for ways to reduce load on Kafka by integrating with Apache Pinot for example (link below to an NYC-based Meetup on this topic). There was conspicuously little content specific to generative AI, which was a bit surprising given the attention the industry at large has given the topic in 2023. Streaming data absolutely has a tremendous role to play in generative AI, in fine tuning foundational models, optimizing prompts, contextualizing and augmenting outputs, etc. Stay tuned for plenty more on that topic!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cloudera perspective:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Data streams are part of a much broader data lifecycle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kafka can’t do it all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Kafka shines when utilized as the real-time bus for application integration and as the message buffer for analytics workflows. When stretched beyond those core capabilities however, it becomes overly complex and carries significant technical overhead. That’s why a complete approach to streaming is needed. An efficient and scalable streaming architecture should be simple yet complete with tooling to address continuous iterative development cycles.  That includes first class support for data distribution (&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/moving-enterprise-data-from-anywhere-to-any-system-made-easy/"&gt;aka universal data distribution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;), edge data capture, stream filtering, independently modifiable stream processing that is accessible to analysts, and integration with data at rest for low cost accessible storage. Lastly, real-time processing and movement of multi structured data including prompts and embeddings is critical for harnessing the transformative power of AI.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**总结**

本文介绍了Mike Rodden创建的AI-powered博客Softwine.ai，该博客结合了葡萄酒和技术领域，旨在促进这两个领域的跨界对话。Mike通过博客分享有关葡萄酒和技术的知识、观点和新闻，并探讨了AI在葡萄园管理和葡萄酒行业中的应用。AI在博客中发挥了重要作用，扮演图形设计师和文章大纲生成器的角色，帮助提高博客的效率。Mike使用Hostinger AI Website Builder搭建了他的网站，并赞赏了这个平台的简单易用和个性化功能。总体而言，Softwine.ai是一个充满激情的项目，旨在促进葡萄酒和技术两个领域之间的交流和思考。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Rodden is a software product manager from Boston with a hobby: he is the creative force behind &lt;a href="http://www.softwine.ai" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Softwine.ai&lt;/a&gt;, an AI-powered blog about wine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Softwine.ai combines two topics that may initially appear mutually exclusive – winemaking and technology. So when Mike writes about wine, it’s always through a modern lens, focused on the technological frontier of the industry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Mike had built a few websites before, he was looking for a simpler platform for his blog. Hostinger AI Website Builder was the ideal solution – its Plug&amp;#8217;n&amp;#8217;Play nature let Mike get his vision off the ground in no time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-vino-veritas"&gt;In Vino Veritas&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wine had always been a passion of Mike’s, but he became even more interested in it after learning about the Wine &amp;amp; Spirit Education Trust (WSET) program. It took two years to finish, and in September this year, Mike celebrated achieving his WSET certification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike started Softwine.ai as a way to bridge the gap between his hobby and profession. The blog allows him to share knowledge, opinions, and news in two contrasting areas – wine and technology – with aims to spark cross-conversation in both arenas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Softwine illustration. " class="wp-image-5635" height="610" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/softwine-art-1024x610.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The wine industry is a little bit traditional – they don&amp;#8217;t adapt to technology super well,” Mike reveals. “But there are some wineries that are really embracing it. They&amp;#8217;re doing some cool stuff, like using data analytics to predict when they have to use chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the kind of subject matter you can expect on Softwine.ai. The blog covers topics like AI technology’s role in integrated pest management (IPM), using weather data to manage vineyards, whether computers can replace sommeliers, and so on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog has also become an effective way to stimulate Mike’s creativity, which would otherwise remain untapped.&amp;nbsp; Since his day job doesn’t provide him with many opportunities to put pen to paper, the blog is a great way to fill the gap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The majority of my day-to-day is more product marketing than actual engineering. Content writing was something I hadn&amp;#8217;t practiced in a long time. So it&amp;#8217;s been a cool way to both practice a little bit and have a creative outlet,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-the-best-collaborator"&gt;AI – The Best Collaborator&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike is the only person behind the blog, with AI having a big enough impact to be featured as a contributor on &lt;a href="https://www.softwine.ai/team" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Softwine.ai’s Team page&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Softwine illustration." class="wp-image-5636" height="574" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/softwine-art-2-1024x574.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, AI is the blog’s graphic designer – it comes up with imaginative illustrations and helps Softwine.ai establish a unique and authentic look. Mike also uses AI-generative technology for article outlines and content creation. As a result, Mike can be more efficient with the limited amount of time he can dedicate to the blog – keeping a close eye on output as part of the editing process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These AI models are actually coming up with ideas I never would have thought of. It could be something I’d never heard of in the wine industry before but then you look it up, and there are so many fresh topics I wouldn’t have been aware of otherwise,” Mike smiles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It does take a good amount of work to make a decent post. But the ability to quickly come up with an outline to just throw your ideas in an order that makes sense – that kind of thing definitely saves a ton of time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hostinger-ai-website-builder-experience"&gt;The Hostinger AI Website Builder Experience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike also used the powers of AI to get the site off the ground. He came across the Hostinger Website Builder when searching online for an accessible platform that wouldn’t be too complex to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’d used other builders and content management systems before to build a couple of websites, and it wasn&amp;#8217;t super impressive. I was looking for something a little bit more out of the box,” Mike reveals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having used Hostinger Website Builder’s AI functionality right off the bat, Mike was impressed with how simple it was to customize the layout of the site and make adjustments on the go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I really like how easy it is to adjust any grid lines and spacing. Everything I do seems to be one or two clicks away at the most, which is great,” Mike says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And since site management is so effortless, Mike can dedicate his time to what matters most – creating standout content for his blog. He doesn’t need to worry about website performance, either – his AI-powered blog is lightweight and loads fast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-days-of-wine-and-roses"&gt;Days of Wine and Roses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the blog is still relatively new, Mike expects its traffic to grow organically in the coming months. He doesn’t rely on paid advertisements to spread awareness; instead, he’s implementing SEO strategies to help Softwine.ai climb the search ranks and bring more visitors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Softwine illustration." class="wp-image-5637" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/softwine-art-3-1024x683.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mike isn’t planning to monetize the blog because he wants it to remain a passion project and eventually turn it into a medium for learning. Most important of all is the blog’s natural ability to spark conversation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wine and technology don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of overlap in general. I want to get both camps interested in one another. For that, I like to pick out topics that will make people think and inspire debate. This is especially important since when it comes to wine, people can be a little stubborn in adapting to new things,” Mike says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the reason why Mike doesn’t shy away from controversial subjects – it’s all about giving people food (or drink) for thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get your passion project off the ground in minutes with Hostinger Website Builder, just like Mike did. Start building now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/website-builder?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=clientstories&amp;amp;utm_campaign=intext&amp;amp;utm_content=20231017-softwine-website-builder" rel="follow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-5640" height="300" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/Website-Builder_in-text-banner-1024x300.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Do you feel exhausted after interacting with people? Do you tend to have many thoughts but express them rarely? If so, there&amp;#8217;s no need to stress: you might just be an introvert, and that&amp;#8217;s perfectly fine. Although it might seem that the world is full of extroverted personalities, a &lt;a href="https://www.themyersbriggs.com/en-US/Connect-With-Us/Blog/2020/January/World-Introvert-Day-2020"&gt;significant portion&lt;/a&gt; of the global population is introverted, with some estimates reaching up to 56%. Being introverted is a natural aspect of your personality, akin to having a distinct character trait. Recognize that being introverted doesn&amp;#8217;t necessitate fixing or change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;#8217;ll explore valuable tips and strategies that can help introverts not only navigate but also thrive and excel in the software industry. We&amp;#8217;ll offer practical advice that has proven effective, empowering introverts to embrace their strengths and succeed in this dynamic field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-introversion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Introversion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the main content, let&amp;#8217;s understand the concept of introversion. The &lt;a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/introversion"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; defines introversion as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An orientation toward the internal private world of one’s self and one’s inner thoughts and feelings, rather than toward the outer world of people and things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To elaborate, introversion describes individuals who prefer spending time alone or with a few close friends rather than in large social settings. Introverts find solace and inspiration in solitude, and excessive social interaction can be draining for them. They excel in activities that require deep concentration, introspective thinking, and self-rejuvenation. Introversion is simply a natural characteristic of some individuals, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the definition of introversion might lead some to mistakenly think that all introverts are self-centered and reserved. Just like anyone else, introverts have diverse personalities, behaviors, and interests. While extroverts might thrive in large social gatherings and draw energy from external stimuli, introverts may find such situations overwhelming. Importantly, introverts often demonstrate extroverted qualities within their imagination. They bring to social dynamics thoughtful insights, careful analysis, and a calm perspective, enriching interactions in profound ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="characteristics-of-introverts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of Introverts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An introverted individual might exhibit the following traits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preference for solitude&lt;/strong&gt;: They value personal space, which allows them self-reflection, deep thinking, and growth. It&amp;#8217;s a time for rejuvenation, not loneliness.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective socialization&lt;/strong&gt;: They excel in one-on-one settings, prioritizing meaningful connections over large gatherings.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preference for written communication&lt;/strong&gt;: They often communicate better in writing, taking the time to craft their words.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoidance of the limelight&lt;/strong&gt;: They generally feel more at ease in less spotlight-focused environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active listening and observation&lt;/strong&gt;: Their attentive listening is invaluable, making them thoughtful participants in conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Paulo Coelho, a Brazillian novelist, once expressed &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7187940-blessed-are-those-who-do-not-fear-solitude-who-are"&gt;his perspective on solitude&lt;/a&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blessed are those who do not fear solitude, who are not afraid of their own company, who are not always desperately looking for something to do, something to amuse themselves with, something to judge. If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Paulo Coelho&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s discuss how to leverage introversion as a strength in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embracing Introversion in Tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding and embracing your introverted qualities is crucial in the tech industry. Introverts often think independently, forming unique perspectives. Whether this stems from a love of solitude or frequent alone time, it&amp;#8217;s a trait that can inspire disruptive ideas and innovations. So, harness this power to flourish in tech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, several successful entrepreneurs, such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Marissa Mayer, Larry Page, and Elon Musk, identify as introverts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a Q&amp;amp;A session, Bill Gates was once questioned about his success in a world that is predominantly extroverted,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/05/bill-gates-how-to-succeed-as-an-introvert/"&gt;shared his perspective on being an introvert&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I think introverts can do quite well. If you’re clever you can learn to get the benefits of being an introvert, which might be, say, being willing to go off for a few days and think about a tough problem, read everything you can, push yourself very hard to think out on the edge of that area. Then, if you come up with something, if you want to hire people, get them excited, build a company around that idea, you better learn what extroverts do, you better hire some extroverts, like Steve Ballmer I would claim as an extrovert, and tap into both sets of skills in order to have a company that thrives both as in deep thinking and building teams and going out into the world to sell those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-a-supportive-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a Supportive Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a misconception to assume all introverts avoid networking. Networking isn&amp;#8217;t exclusive to extroverts; introverts, with their active listening, observation, and genuine curiosity, can also excel in building relationships. Remember, introversion doesn&amp;#8217;t limit career success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Platforms like LinkedIn offer a space for expanding professional networks. Joining forums, tech communities, and social media groups can also help. Within the workplace, seeking mentors and peer support, especially from those who understand introversion, can be invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="navigating-teamwork-and-collaboration"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating Teamwork and Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re familiar with modern software development practices, you&amp;#8217;ll know that many teams implement Agile methodologies. In the software industry, teamwork and collaboration form the cornerstone of daily operations. Engaging in discussions is essential to various aspects of the development process. While tasks like coding and documentation can be done individually, many activities rely on group conversations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In software development:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design is a collective process involving team discussions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Architecture decisions arise from discussions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pair and mob programming encourage collaboration and team dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Code and pull request reviews involve feedback exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Scrum rituals, such as daily stand-ups and retrospectives, use discussions to align the team and refine the development process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For introverts, these routines can initially seem daunting. Agile demands frequent team interactions, brainstorming sessions, and daily stand-ups, which can be socially taxing. The perpetual need for social interaction can sap their energy. Moreover, introverts might struggle to express their thoughts in larger group settings because they tend to reflect deeply before speaking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a manager, your responsibility includes fostering an inclusive environment for introverts. Individuals in leadership roles should recognize and accommodate introverted team members. Understand that they might not always feel at ease speaking in group settings. Consider implementing anonymous communication channels or feedback methods. Regular check-ins with introverted team members can ensure they remain engaged. Such actions show care, motivating them to commit and deliver quality work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By cultivating psychological safety, introverts will feel more confident sharing their ideas. This nurtures a collaborative atmosphere, incorporating varied viewpoints from the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mastering-communication-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Communication Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not uncommon for introverts to receive feedback during performance evaluations suggesting greater visibility. This might be a nuanced way of advising them to vocalize their achievements more. It could also indicate that honing communication skills could be advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding this feedback is essential. However, adapting to it shouldn&amp;#8217;t mean forsaking one&amp;#8217;s introverted nature. Improving visibility isn&amp;#8217;t about imitating extroverted tendencies; it&amp;#8217;s about effectively communicating while staying authentic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can enhance your communication by practicing active listening, preparing thoughts beforehand, and being concise. Prioritizing written communication can also be advantageous, allowing clearer articulation of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enhancing communication as an introvert is about striking a balance. It involves utilizing unique strengths to convey ideas and accomplishments effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cultivating-a-growth-mindset"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating a Growth Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The software industry is ever-evolving, with new trends and technologies emerging regularly. Success demands not only a foundation in computer science fundamentals (for certain roles) but also a growth mindset and a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills"&gt;T-shaped &lt;/a&gt;approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;T-shaped developers possess deep expertise in one discipline (the vertical bar of the T) and broader, albeit shallower, knowledge in related fields (the horizontal bar). This model suggests that while having a specialty is crucial, versatility is also valuable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adopting a growth mindset entails actively seeking learning opportunities and viewing challenges as growth prospects. In simpler terms, it&amp;#8217;s the belief that abilities and intelligence can evolve through dedication, practice, and learning. To thrive in tech, remain open to new experiences, such as industry conferences, workshops, or online courses. Familiarizing yourself with emerging tools and technologies not only broadens your horizons but also helps connect with peers who have similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combining a growth mindset with a T-shaped approach ensures adaptability in the tech landscape, fostering continuous learning and relevance in software development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this article underscores the importance of understanding introversion as an intrinsic trait rather than a shortcoming. It&amp;#8217;s crucial for organizations to value independent thought and individual perspectives, enabling introverts to introduce innovative ideas. To succeed in the software domain, introverts must harness their distinctive qualities. Recognizing and leveraging these traits can lead to valuable contributions and a flourishing career in the software sector.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microspeak: The As-Appropriate (AA) interviewer</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231017-00/?p=108897</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One term you may hear when people talk about the process of interviewing at Microsoft is the As Appropriate, or AA, interviewer. Why is the final interview of the day called As Appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name is a holdover from how Microsoft used to structure hiring interviews. The term is not officially used any more, but you may still hear it used informally by old-timers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical interview day used to consist of four (sometimes five) interviews, structured as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Start&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;br /&gt;
(as appropriate)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇒&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Recruiter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇒&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇑&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇗&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;⇓&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan="3"&gt;⇐ ⇐ ⇐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of interviews is called an &lt;i&gt;interview loop&lt;/i&gt; because the candidate travels in a loop through the diagram, starting and ending with the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the interviews assesses not just the candidate&amp;#8217;s technical competence but also other factors such as their initiative, ability to teach themselves new things, and how well they work as part of a team. The results of these interviews are all shared with the recruiter and the final interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final interviewer was typically someone more senior in the hiring group. Historically, their job was to take the information provided by the initial interviewers and, based on their recommendations, decide whether the candidate was still worth pursuing. If so, then they proceeded with the final interview. if not, then they sent the candidate directly to the recruiter after completing their final &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; interview. The final interviewer was called the &amp;#8220;as appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer because the final interview took place only if they felt it was appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;#8220;as appropriate&amp;#8221; was often abbreviated in speech to &amp;#8220;as-app&amp;#8221; (pronouncing the &amp;#8220;app&amp;#8221; like the first syllable of &amp;#8220;application&amp;#8221;), and in writing as &amp;#8220;AA&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft hiring interview process has been reworked several times since those early days. For example, at one point, the interviews were restructured so that the interviewer roles are rotated through the day, to improve throughput:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Candidate 4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Welcome&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="height: 3em;"&gt;Slot 4&lt;br /&gt;
(as-app)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interviewer 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recruiter 4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every interviewer serves as the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer for a candidate. There is no special interviewer who is responsible for being the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the evolution of the interview loop, the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; stopped being optional. Everybody got an &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interview. The role of the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interviewer didn&amp;#8217;t change. It&amp;#8217;s just that the &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221; interview always takes place, regardless of the feedback from the other three interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final interview of the day lost the name &amp;#8220;As appropriate&amp;#8221;, but people who have been conducting interviews for a long time sometimes accidentally slip into the old terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

Read on for the latest news fraud findings from Sift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Account takeovers skyrocket &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five consumers recently surveyed by Sift have experienced account takeover (ATO) attacks, with 62% of those taking place in the past year. The prevalence of these types of attacks is supported by Sift’s latest &lt;a href="https://resources.sift.com/ebook/q3-2023-digital-trust-safety-index-account-takeover-data-consumer-insights-and-emerging-trends/"&gt;Q3 Digital Trust &amp;amp; Safety Index&lt;/a&gt; findings which reveal a staggering 354% year-over-year increase in ATO in Q2 2023 across Sift’s global network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While AI has been a hot topic in the fraud prevention industry, it’s automation that’s still driving the speed and scale of many of these attacks, with the sale of bots that provide ‘ATO-as-a-Service’ for purchase on the deep web.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fraud becomes as sophisticated as the technology being used to commit it,” says Rebecca Alter, Trust and Safety Architect at Sift, “and increasingly innovative types of automation pose a threat to merchants that aren’t ready to match its speed or account for its accessibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Explore more highlights from the report in &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/e-commerce-fraud-to-cost-48-billion-globally-this-year-as-attacks-skyrocket-report-says/"&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sift’s newest integrations and automation capabilities &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With fraudsters collaborating and networking across borders as part of a full-fledged &lt;a href="https://sift.com/fraud-center/fraud-schemes"&gt;Fraud Economy&lt;/a&gt;, Sift is committed to expanding its risk management capabilities to a wider network of fraud fighters. The most recent example of this effort is Sift’s new Dispute Management integrations with PayPal and Adyen, two of the largest payment processors globally. With the combination of Sift’s &lt;a href="https://blog.sift.com/payment-protection-and-dispute-management/"&gt;Dispute Management and Payment Protection solutions&lt;/a&gt;, users can improve the overall payment experience and reduce potential fraud or disputes for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sift Dispute Management has made it faster and easier to respond to chargebacks. Effective integration between Sift, our payment processor, and our own internal tools has improved a once labor intensive process into an efficient, automated system,” said Taylor Snyder, Manager of Risk &amp;amp; Compliance at online bill pay company, Doxo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More industry and customer recognition for Sift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the &lt;a href="https://blog.sift.com/sift-2023-forrester-wave-digital-fraud-management/"&gt;recognition as a ‘Leader’&lt;/a&gt; in the latest Forrester Wave report, Sift also earned accolades from &lt;a href="https://www.marketplacerisk.com/post/marketplace-risk-recognizes-solution-provider-excellence-program-honorees"&gt;Marketplace Risk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/09/15/2744127/0/en/Sift-Named-a-Leader-in-Fraud-Detection-E-commerce-Fraud-Detection-and-Risk-Based-Authentication-on-G2.html"&gt;G2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sift was recognized as one of the top fraud prevention and chargeback management solutions by Marketplace Risk’s Solution Provider Excellence program, which is intended to help marketplaces and digital platforms in selecting solution providers with a proven track record of success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;G2, the largest and most trusted software marketplace, released their Fall 2023 Reports revealing Sift as the only fraud solution provider to have earned Leader status in all three key fraud prevention categories: Fraud Detection, E-Commerce Fraud Detection, and Risk-Based Authentication. G2 rankings are based on authentic customer reviews and scores; Sift’s ranking is based on over 180 authentic Sift user ratings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is one recent review: &amp;#8220;Sift is the partner of choice for fraud prevention. Sift is one of the few tools in our software stacks that has such a clear ROI. We have total transparency with our entire order pipeline to prevent fraudulent purchases. The UI is intuitive and the rules-based engine makes creating and editing rules on the fly a breeze.”&lt;/p&gt;

**大纲：**
- 介绍SCARF及其重要性和影响

- 依赖范围的确定和删除路线图的创建
- 动态和静态分析的使用
- 自动化和人工干预的结合

**总结：**
本文介绍了Meta公司的Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF)以及其在产品释放方面的重要性和影响。SCARF为工程师提供了指导，并结合自动化技术减轻了工程师的负担。文章指出了产品释放的复杂性和潜在的失败模式，并介绍了SCARF如何通过工作流管理和删除路线图的创建来解决这些问题。文章还介绍了动态和静态分析技术在SCARF中的应用，以及自动化和人工干预之间的结合。通过SCARF的使用，Meta公司成功地删除了大量的无用数据和代码，提高了产品和服务的质量。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF) is Meta&amp;#8217;s unused code and data deletion framework.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF guides engineers through deprecating a product safely and efficiently via an internal tool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF combines this tooling with automation to reduce load on engineers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At Meta, we are constantly innovating and experimenting by building and shipping many different products, and those products comprise thousands of individual features. As part of this healthy technology lifecycle, it is inevitable that certain products or features will be deprecated. For example, in 2015 we launched a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2015/06/introducing-moments/"&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;photo-sharing app called Moments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, which was later deprecated in 2019. So, how did we efficiently and safely remove all of the code and data related to Moments without adversely affecting Meta&amp;#8217;s other products and services?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this three-part blog series, we will discuss the complexities involved in removing a product from a complex portfolio of products and the framework Meta has built to drive the automation of this process, our Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF). SCARF has had an important impact at Meta. In the last year, it has removed petabytes of unused data across &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;12.8M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; different data types stored in 21 different data systems. Over the last five years it has deleted over 100M lines of code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The first post will introduce the complexities faced when systematically deprecating products safely in a large organization and the internal workflow tools we have developed. The second post will explain how SCARF automates the removal of dead code and the infrastructure that powers it. The third post will discuss SCARF&amp;#8217;s orchestration for safely identifying and deleting unused data types across various data systems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Failure modes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Without established guidance detailing the process for determining when and how to remove a product or feature, a few failure modes might emerge. Consider the example of launching a time-specific feature for a large event that happens once every few years. Does it make sense to keep all the code and data related to it until the next event? Most of the time, maintaining code for a number of years that is unused is less desirable than building a new experience for the next event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Engineers who do attempt the cleanup might find that doing so is a very time-consuming job. Correctly identifying all the pieces of code and data associated with the product and only taking action on those specific pieces of code and data is a laborious process. It’s possible that a table that is still being used, or code that is still required for a shared use case, could be included in the scope of a deletion effort. For example, some tables might be shared between products. Hypothetically, Moments may have started life as an extension to Facebook photos before it became a separate app.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Most importantly, it&amp;#8217;s crucial that any cleanup efforts only remove things that are actively being deprecated or are already entirely unused. Deleting something that is actively being used in production could cause bad experiences for users. The interconnected nature of features within a large product like Facebook makes this a very real possibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;How did we solve this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Meta has developed playbooks describing how to safely deprecate a product. These playbooks describe how to notify people and give them time to download their data, how to disable the product safely, and when to eventually delete the underlying code and data. They describe how and when to perform a product or feature deprecation, but actually removing the code and data for a product or feature is an engineering problem with an engineering solution. The engineering solution we have built does not replace these guides, but enables engineers to more safely and efficiently complete the product deprecation process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this post, we’ll describe Meta&amp;#8217;s SCARF and how it guides engineers through this cleanup process. In subsequent posts, we will discuss its limitations and how they are mitigated by our automated dead code and data removal platforms. To start, we introduce Meta&amp;#8217;s suite of internal tools developed to orchestrate both of these systems in guiding engineers to remove large products with complex dependencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Introducing workflow management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To simplify the task of removing a product, Meta has built a product deprecation workflow management tool into SCARF to help engineers delete a product&amp;#8217;s dead code and unused data safely and efficiently. This tool lets engineers understand and break down the steps they’ll go through during the deprecation and coordinates the actions of SCARF to bring automation to bear with an engineer&amp;#8217;s guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Engineers can import their product or feature into SCARF, which then determines the constituent pieces of code and data, and identifies internal and external dependencies on these assets. SCARF automatically processes this information to guide engineers on the correct order of operations to delete assets safely and shows their progress relative to the desired end-state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Any assets that are safe to be deleted immediately will be handled by SCARF&amp;#8217;s automated code and data cleanup systems (which will be covered in more depth in our subsequent blog posts). Engineers are able to track this automation and accelerate it by using their domain knowledge combined with SCARF&amp;#8217;s scoping analysis, which determines the assets that are safe to remove. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Scoping the deprecation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Understanding when a piece of code or data is used by other components of a product is important, and detecting when an asset is referenced in the codebase of other products is crucial for a safe deprecation (the internal and external dependencies, respectively). For example, we would not want to leave a dead web link between two different products because that could lead to a bad user experience. An engineer deprecating a product must think carefully about each such dependency in the external boundary of their product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To avoid these complications, engineers begin their deprecations by scoping the project, recursively adding any assets that should be deleted, and flagging dependencies that should be severed. For example, if Moments had an integration with the Facebook app’s Sharing feature, this dependency must be broken because the Facebook Sharing feature itself may not be in scope for removal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20690" height="491" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image1.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;However, if the Sharing feature was unique to Moments, that would change the scope of removal as we would want to delete that component as well. Adding new assets into the scope of the project as it progresses requires further analysis to discover the new boundaries of the internal and external dependencies. These dependencies are expected to change over time as an engineer discovers extra components to delete. Alternatively, we may identify code that is actually a shared component and should not be deleted. Attempting to finalize this boundary from the start is very difficult, so we allow developers to redefine the boundary over time as the deprecation progresses to reflect this growing understanding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The graph of components, their internal and external dependencies, and related data assets, can grow extremely complex in large products. SCARF simplifies this problem by only requiring engineers to make “Flag Dependency” or “Add to Project” decisions at the boundaries. It then internally computes the correct deletion order for everything inside the project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20691" height="577" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image2.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Creating a deletion roadmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Once the set of unused assets to be deleted has been determined, SCARF will analyze the internal and external dependencies and create a deletion roadmap that outlines the correct sequence of steps for deleting everything safely. The roadmap is refreshed each day as changes are made, either from targeted assets being deleted or from modifications to the component graph through the Flag and Add actions. This roadmap is one of the workflow management tool&amp;#8217;s most crucial features. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Without guidance, engineers may attempt to delete everything in one fell swoop by removing an entire code directory without accounting for external systems’ dependencies, where changes cannot be committed atomically. Another example includes deleting data before the code that reads and writes it, which may lead to new data being created that must be cleaned again. Deprecations must be staggered to account for these various requirements and this entails that every deprecation be performed in a coordinated, multi-step process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The key implementation detail is the encoding of business logic that allows products and apps to function in Meta&amp;#8217;s systems. By encoding how users are able to engage with products and how those products communicate with other Meta services, we can ensure that upstream assets are always deleted before their dependencies. For example, typically a product will comprise code in many different languages across multiple repositories. An engineer needs to delete their mobile code (Java, Objective-C) in order to free up and delete their server-side GraphQL definitions. Deleting those GraphQL definitions makes it possible to delete business logic; deleting business logic makes it possible to delete data schema definitions, which in turn allows unused data to be deleted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The following diagram is a hypothetical example of the type of information that is presented to an engineer in their deletion roadmap. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20692" height="997" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image3.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This sequencing isn&amp;#8217;t obvious at the get-go! The links between these system boundaries are often weaker than the link between, for example, two classes in the same language; and the link may often only be discovered by an engineer during continuous testing on their code change requests. SCARF&amp;#8217;s encoding of these inter-system boundaries enables the deletion roadmap which in turn enables engineers to stagger their removal actions safely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Powering the analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF’s workflow management tool is powered by detailed metrics from a combination of both static and dynamic analysis. Information about code is gathered from SCARF’s unified code dependency graph and information about data is gathered from SCARF’s asset usage analysis. These mechanisms will be discussed in more detail in our subsequent blog posts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;These metrics give the workflow management tool a very important property: If metrics can be found for an asset, it is in use and should be blocked from automated deletion. Correspondingly, any asset for which no metrics are available is ready for automatic deletion. With these metrics in hand, SCARF can show engineers a precise explanation of exactly what is blocking the automation and what steps they must manually perform in order for the automation to proceed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This completeness property allows SCARF to automatically begin removing code and data that is unused, while simultaneously showing engineers which things must be handled manually. At every step of the process, both engineers and automation work together to complete the deprecation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Once an engineer has acted upon this information and removed more dead code and unused data in accordance with the deletion roadmap, the continuous indexing and analysis of SCARF will detect these changes and automatically trigger any code/data cleanup it can. Finally, the workflow management tool will update its deletion roadmap to identify the next set of items requiring manual intervention, and the process is repeated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20693" height="582" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Automating-product-deprecation-at-Meta-image4.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Is automation sufficient?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Some of the usage signals SCARF highlights (such as API endpoints that still receive traffic) do not necessarily cause compilation errors if they are ignored and are more subjective as to whether they should stop automated deletion. If the endpoint for a product receives a single request each day, should we delete it right away? We have already identified that the endpoint belongs to a product we are removing so we know it should be removed eventually, but the answer to when it is correct to delete it is ultimately a business decision. Further, we understand that mistakes can happen and that the automation is not expected to be 100 percent perfect. Therefore, SCARF errs on the side of caution as a mistaken deletion could lead to unrecoverable errors or data loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Correspondingly, SCARF offers the ability to override signals that prevent automation from taking action. In the example above, an engineer might decide we wish to proceed with deleting the API endpoint despite small amounts of traffic. This is extremely valuable when cleaning up internal products, tools, and services. Internal tools are built and deprecated with a much faster cadence than an external product often is and SCARF can help determine each individual internal user of a tool who needs to be asked if they’re agreeable with it being removed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This feature creates a feedback loop between engineers and automation. Our automation highlights usage signals; engineers then triage those usage signals (either by modifying code to remove them or, if applicable, marking the signal as not sufficient to block deletion); then our automation can proceed to progress the SCARF project. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To further accelerate manual changes performed by engineers, SCARF also provides an instant code change feature. SCARF suggests a means for breaking a dependency through a targeted code change and an engineer is able to select one of a predetermined set of possible ways to break it. The change is immediately previewable and a change request can be immediately generated for review by other engineers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;After an engineer has progressed through a majority of the deletion roadmap and removed the entry points, client code, server code, and any other in-scope assets, they will be left with unused tables of data that can now be automatically cleaned up by SCARF. This automation will be explained in more detail in our future blog posts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Integration with other tools at Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SCARF is useful for more than just product deprecation. We surface deprecation as an option when notifying engineers about routine maintenance or upgrade work on individual assets. For example, when asking developers to migrate away from a legacy internal API, we can include an option for them to deprecate the callsite or affected product and import their code into SCARF. Deprecating something can, in many cases, be more work than performing a simple upgrade, but deprecation means that no future maintenance work is necessary. Once something has been removed, future maintenance costs go to zero.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We hope you’ll look forward to our subsequent posts in the series, which will cover SCARF&amp;#8217;s automated code and data deletion, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

此篇文章介绍了Amazon CodeWhisperer的定制化功能，它可以根据私有代码库为开发人员生成特定的代码推荐。目前现有的AI编码协助工具通常只能基于开源代码进行训练，无法定制化，这给开发人员带来了一系列挑战。而Amazon CodeWhisperer的定制化功能允许组织自定义代码推荐，包括私有库中的内部库、API、包、类和方法。通过连接GitHub、GitLab或BitBucket等代码库，管理员可以创建定制化，并在团队成员的IDE中获取实时的定制化代码推荐。这项功能有助于提高开发人员的生产力，并确保代码的质量和安全性。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;An AI coding companion, such as &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/"&gt;Amazon CodeWhisperer&lt;/a&gt;, aims to improve developers’ productivity by helping them write code quickly and securely. However, in particular cases, developers need to have code recommendations based on their internal libraries and APIs they extensively use every day.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As most of the existing AI coding companion tools are trained only on open-source codes, they lack the capability to customize the code recommendations using private code repositories. This limitation presents a variety of challenges for developers. Developers have a difficulty learning how to use internal libraries correctly and avoid security problems. For large codebases, it requires hours of reading documentation to understand what code needs to be written to complete the task.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now in Preview — &amp;nbsp;Amazon CodeWhisperer Customization Capability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I’m excited to announce Amazon CodeWhisperer customization capability (in preview) that enables organizations to customize CodeWhisperer to generate specific code recommendations from private code repositories. With this feature, developers who are part of &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-prof-devs.html"&gt;Amazon CodeWhisperer Professional&lt;/a&gt; tier can now receive real-time code recommendations that include their internal libraries, APIs, packages, classes, and methods.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you’re a developer working for a hypothetical food delivery company called AnyCompany. You’re given a task to process a list of unassigned food deliveries around the driver’s current location. Previously, with CodeWhisperer, it would not know the correct internal APIs to process unassigned food deliveries or getting driver’s current location as this isn’t publicly available information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now, with customization capability, you can ask CodeWhisperer to provide recommendations that include specific code related to the company’s internal services. The following screenshot shows how CodeWhisperer generates codes based on the internal codebase just by writing a set of comments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-code.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75995 size-full" height="560" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-code.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="813" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the customization capability of utilizing your internal codebase, CodeWhisperer now understands the intent, determines which internal and public APIs are best suited to the task, and generates code recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How It Works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The explanation above described how you can use CodeWhisperer customization capability as a developer. Now, let me share how it works and how you can get started.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-1-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75782" height="586" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-1-1-1024x586.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To create a customization, you need to complete the following steps as a CodeWhisperer administrator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Administer your end users as &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/as-whisper-admin.html"&gt;CodeWhisperer administrator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Connect to existing repositories. You can connect one or more code repositories in your GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket account using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; Connections or manually upload all of your codes into an &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)&lt;/a&gt; bucket.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create a customization. CodeWhisperer will customize its model based on your codebase.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Activate the customization for your team members. Once the customization is created, you can review and manually activate the customization to make it available automatically in your team members’ IDEs.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This capability provides two main advantages: providing real-time customized code recommendations that are specific to organizations and ensuring the protection of valuable intellectual property. Organizations can now promote the use of code that meets their quality and security standards based on their codes in existing repositories.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, CodeWhisperer helps to ensure the security of your codes by providing the option to encrypt your customization data using customer managed keys in &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"&gt;AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)&lt;/a&gt;. This customization data will be deleted once the customization job finishes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me show you how you can use the Amazon CodeWhisperer customization capability.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get started, I need to create a customization. I need to have administrator access to navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Create customization &lt;/strong&gt;page on the Amazon CodeWhisperer dashboard.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-2-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75991 size-large" height="1024" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-2-1-754x1024.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="754" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Create customization&lt;/strong&gt; page, I can connect the desired private code repositories I want CodeWhisperer to train. Currently, CodeWhisperer customization capability supports connection to GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket via &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; Connections. If I have codes that are not in any code repositories, I can also manually upload my codes into an S3 bucket and define the Amazon S3 URI.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot shows that I have existing connections with my code repositories using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; Connections. I can also create a new connection by selecting&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Create new connection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-3-1-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75993 size-large" height="625" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-3-1-1-1024x625.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then, I can select&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Create Customization&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;so CodeWhisperer can start training the model based on the codes available in the connection. The duration to complete this process depends on the size of the code repositories.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-4-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75994 size-large" height="846" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/17/cw-custom-4-1-1024x846.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When the customization is ready, CodeWhisperer will not activate it automatically. This gives me the flexibility to activate the customizations just when I need them. But before I demonstrate that, I’d like to explain the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;score.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In short, the evaluation score helps me to measure the customization’s accuracy in predicting and providing code recommendations based on the codes in my code repositories. It provides a score in one of three categories: 1) Very Good, with a score ranging from 7–10; 2) Fair, with a score ranging from 4–7; and 3) Poor, with a score ranging from 0–4. It’s recommended to activate the customization if the evaluation score is 6 or higher. If the evaluation score is less than desired, I need to make sure that I’m providing enough codes for customization and provide a new code dataset that extensively contains references to internal APIs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here, I can see the &lt;strong&gt;Evaluation score&lt;/strong&gt; for my customization is 8, and I’m happy with this result. Then, I can select&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Activate&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to start using this customization.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75777" height="488" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-4-1024x488.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once I have activated the customizations, I can define the access to selected customizations by selecting&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Add users&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, I can give access to the customizations for selected team members who have been added as users for Amazon CodeWhisperer Professional tier. To do that, I can follow the guide from &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/as-whisper-admin.html"&gt;the&amp;nbsp;Administering end users&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-6.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75778" height="654" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-6-1024x654.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then, once my team members sign in via AWS Toolkit in their IDEs, they will see the available customizations and can start using them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-8.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75977 size-large" height="542" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-8-1024x542.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With Amazon CodeWhisperer, I can create multiple customizations by providing different code repositories. This feature is useful if I want to build customizations for code recommendations for certain teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-9-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-75984 size-large" height="293" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/16/cw-custom-9-1-1024x293.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As administrator, I can also monitor the performance of each of the customizations by navigating to the CodeWhisperer dashboard page. This page summarizes useful data such as user activity, how many lines of code were suggested by CodeWhisperer and accepted by my team members, and how many security scans have successfully been run from IDEs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-7.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75779" height="647" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/10/08/cw-custom-7-1024x647.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Amazon CodeWhisperer customization capability also follows the supported IDEs as part of AWS Toolkit by Amazon CodeWhisperer, such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ JetBrains, Visual Studio, and AWS Cloud9. This feature also provides support for most popular programming languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build Lightning Web Components Faster with Code Snippets</title>
      <link>https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2023/10/build-lightning-web-components-faster-with-code-snippets.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implementing &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components"&gt;Salesforce Base Lightning Web Components&lt;/a&gt; just got easier with the addition of HTML Code Snippets in &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode"&gt;the Salesforce Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt; for Visual Studio Code (v58.6.2). This update complements JavaScript and Apex Code Snippets which have been a part of the VS Code extension since 2018. The introduction of HTML Code Snippets allows developers to produce the boilerplate markup required for an LWC and fill in the property values without having to pivot between their editor and documentation. By using Code Snippets, developers will no longer forget a property, misspell a component name, or leave out ARIA elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will explain what Code Snippets are, how to use them, and how you can build your own for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are Code Snippets?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this blog focuses on Code Snippets for HTML, they can be written and scoped to any language. Code Snippets leverage IntelliSense to offer robust code-completion options directly in VS Code. What makes Code Snippets different from traditional code completion/hinting tools is their ability to contain large blocks of code or markup with designated points for customization. When a code snippet is inserted into your file, pre-defined sections are made available to enter variable names, adjust properties, or pick from a list of values — all while keeping your hands on the keyboard. The blocks of code provide handy default values as you might find in developer documentation, further allowing you to speed along in the development process. Default implementations serve as a way to encourage best practices and reduce needless back and forth during code review. With Code Snippets, developers spend less time writing boilerplate code and more time adjusting the settings that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Snippets really demonstrate their power when you see them in action. Take for example a custom component that displays a Lightning Button Menu. To produce this functionality, the developer creates a parent Lightning Button Menu, nests a template, and iterates over the list of Menu Items which produces this code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;pre language="html"&amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;lightning-button-menu
alternative-text="Show menu"
menu-alignment="auto"
&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;template for:each={myMenuItems} for:item="menuItem"&amp;amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;lt;lightning-menu-item
    key={menuItem.id}
    value={menuItem.value}
    label={menuItem.label}
    &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/lightning-menu-item&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;/template&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;/lightning-button-menu&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with our screen recording video below in which the developer uses Code Snippets to quickly produce the same block of code. With a few quick keystrokes, the outer Lightning Button Menu, for-loop, and corresponding Menu Item tags are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Code Snippets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML Code Snippets were introduced in version 58.6.2 of the &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode"&gt;Salesforce Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt; for VS Code and cover &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components"&gt;Salesforce Base Lightning Web Components&lt;/a&gt;. With your desired file open in the editor, you can search for code snippets in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the VS Code command palette and run the Insert Snippet command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open an HTML file in VS Code and begin typing the component name, for example &lt;code&gt;pill&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, type the component name, &lt;code&gt;pill&lt;/code&gt;. A menu appears showing multiple &lt;code&gt;lwc-pill&lt;/code&gt; components that offer implementation variations that coincide with &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-pill/example"&gt;component library examples&lt;/a&gt;. Select &lt;code&gt;lwc-pill-avatar&lt;/code&gt; by clicking the name or highlighting the option and hitting the tab on the keyboard. Immediately, the markup will paste into the editor and the cursor will land on the first element requiring input. Upon entering the label value, press the tab to go to the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; property. You can choose to use the variable reference as is or update it to match the variable name in your JavaScript file. Reaching the variant property, two options will be presented as a drop-down menu, allowing you to pick either of the two valid options.

/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I create my own?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! Code Snippets are a great resource for project teams who build custom components or leverage repetitive code throughout their application and want to make it easy for team members to implement patterns. Some quick examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commented file headers to include your company name, license, etc.; in fact, Salesforce includes such a snippet in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/blob/develop/.vscode/snippets.code-snippets"&gt;VS Code Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the correct copyright notices are included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom LWC component implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API call constructors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated test scaffolding; just having the curly braces and parents filled out is a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects can create their own sets of snippets by creating a &lt;code&gt;snippets.code-snippets&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;.vscode/&lt;/code&gt; directory of their project. Since it is a part of the project’s repository, all team members will benefit from updates throughout the dev lifecycle. This allows teams to make opinionated decisions about the structure of code and how it is implemented. If components have a lot of properties or implementation patterns, multiple versions of a code snippet can be created to accommodate different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing to VS Code Extension Snippets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode"&gt;Salesforce Extensions for VS Code&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source project and is open to external contributions. Be sure to follow the repo’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;contributing instructions&lt;/a&gt; which specify how to set up your environment, structure your commits, and sign a Contributor’s License Agreement. To test your updates, save changes locally, open &lt;b&gt;Run&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Debug&lt;/b&gt; from the sidebar, select &lt;b&gt;Launch Extension&lt;/b&gt;, and click &lt;b&gt;Play&lt;/b&gt;. This will compile the extension and open a new VS Code window, allowing you to test updates. Once confirmed, commit your changes and submit a Pull Request!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting LWC Code Snippets can be a boon for developers by helping them produce error-free code in a timely fashion. What’s more, teams can build code snippets to meet project needs and spread best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further resources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>**关键词**：用户反馈，开发流程，用户价值，自动化分类，交互式仪表盘

**大纲**：
- 用户反馈在Mercari应用的开发流程中的重要性
- Mercari如何整合用户反馈并改进开发流程
- Hack Fest项目：使用机器学习自动分类用户反馈
- 通过交互式仪表盘改进周度反馈报告
- 未来的改进和合作机会

**总结**：
本文介绍了Mercari如何将用户反馈整合到应用的开发流程中，以增加用户价值和改进应用。他们通过分析和提取用户评论，使用机器学习自动化分类，建立了一个能够有效处理大量用户反馈的系统。之后，他们通过创建交互式仪表盘，使不同团队可以方便地访问和分析用户反馈，进一步改进了开发流程。文章还提到了未来的改进方向，包括更高效的沟通、更多数据整合以及与其他团队的合作。总之，Mercari积极利用用户反馈来提高应用的质量和用户体验，并不断改进流程以提供更多价值给用户。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, a vast amount of users open the App Store or the Google Play Store to leave ratings and reviews about the Mercari application. They generously provide insights into what they like and dislike, what they find valuable, and what they do not. At Mercari, our mission is to &amp;quot;circulate all forms of value to unleash the potential in all people.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User feedback in the form of app reviews is an invaluable connection between our customers and us. Incorporating this feedback into our development process allows us to unleash the full potential of our application and make it even more valuable to our users, which truly resonates with our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of users access our application daily, and chances are, you are one of them! Our users employ a wide range of devices, operating systems, and varying conditions when utilizing the Mercari mobile application (other open apps, available RAM memory, battery saving mode, phone configuration options, and many others). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducting comprehensive testing under all these circumstances is realistically impossible. While we can leverage the power of logs to understand user behavior and identify crashes, user feedback in the form of reviews provides a more profound insight. These reviews tell the stories of people who use and experience our application, sometimes sharing their positive experiences, and at times, encountering difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As QA Engineers and Managers, anything related to user value is of great interest to us. After all, quality can be defined as &amp;quot;Value to Some Person.&amp;quot; In many cases, our users personify that definition. This is why, as a QA team, we have taken the initiative to integrate user feedback into our development process. Guided by the culture at Mercari, we have collaborated with various teams in order to build a process where everyone can harness the immense treasure trove that lies within Mercari&amp;#8217;s application user reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is a process where we leverage ML to analyze, week by week, all reviews given to our app in the Google Play Store and App Store. The summarization and extraction of information improved cross functional communication between our teams, with the combined goals of addressing issues and considering improvements reported by our users, as well as constantly learning what is in the mind of our users and what they value of our products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One recent instance where user feedback took a protagonistic role on our software development process was on the run up to the launch of Mercari&amp;#8217;s new application in 2022, code-named GU, short for &amp;quot;Ground Up&amp;quot;. GU was more than just an update; it was a complete overhaul of the application. If you&amp;#8217;re curious about the whole experience, be sure to check out our article below on the GU application development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related article (&lt;a href="https://mercan.mercari.com/en/articles/35887/"&gt;https://mercan.mercari.com/en/articles/35887/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the importance of involving our users in the development process, we knew that the success of the new app launch hinged on their collaboration. With a diverse range of devices, operating systems, configurations, and conditions, our users offered invaluable perspectives that we couldn&amp;#8217;t simulate in-house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate this communication, we launched volunteer-based beta programs on the App Store and Google Play Store, giving iOS and Android users the opportunity to try out the new application as soon as we had the new version of the app to a certain level of maturity. Users could share their feedback through a dedicated in-app feedback form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened next exceeded our expectations. We were overwhelmed with the sheer volume of feedback from our users, presenting us with the challenge of sorting and categorizing the data into actionable information for our teams. Our software engineers were busy typing away at their keyboards, focusing on delivering our new version as fast as they could, making it impossible to invest in building an automated system to analyze user feedback. Instead, we had no choice but to tackle this task manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a joint effort between our Voice of Customer (VoC) and QA Engineering teams, analyzing the feedback proved to be a complex task. We faced challenges such as identifying duplicate feedback, language barriers, effectively communicating the feedback to the right teams, and keeping up with the daily influx of feedback. It consumed a significant amount of our time. However, our efforts paid off. Not only did we uncover a fair share of hard to reproduce issues on the app, but we were also able to prioritize our tasks based on the quantity of reports received from users on specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s no exaggeration to say that the success of the app launch was partly attributed to the incredible Mercari users who generously shared their feedback. We were able to address problems, compatibility glitches with other apps, crashes, and even gather improvement suggestions. By taking their feedback into account, we avoided the chaos of encountering all of these issues on launch day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine the turmoil that would have ensued if all users experienced these problems simultaneously! Thanks to the continuous iterative approach of listening to feedback and making necessary improvements, we seamlessly transitioned users into the new GU app. At a company level, we learned a valuable lesson about the immeasurable value of user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hack Fest Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successfully launching the GU program and wrapping up Beta testing, I felt something was off with this user feedback channel shutting down. Though analyzing it was time-consuming, it provided valuable insight to our team. Instead of focusing less on this, I wondered if we could process more feedback with a more streamlined approach. To scale effectively, we needed to automate feedback categorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Initial slide of the presentation of our Hack Fest project: Feedback Classification (should have gone with a fancier name)" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prd-engineering-asset/2023/10/bcdc8c2d-voc_qa_process_hack_fest.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Initial slide of the presentation of our Hack Fest project: Feedback Classification (should have gone with a fancier name)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain traction on this notion, I pitched the idea on the ML Engineering Slack channel. Much to my delight, some colleagues showed keen interest, and one ML engineer named Paul Willot went further by becoming committed to making this a reality. Concurrently, I also discussed potential data sources with our Customer Support team and found support there as well, with Kazue Kudo san from their team deciding to champion things from the VoC side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to our bi-annual &lt;a href="https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230621-e066032084/" title="Hack Fest event"&gt;Hack Fest event&lt;/a&gt;, a 3-day coding marathon open to all employees, we began shaping the framework of our project. With other new members, who jumped on board at the last minute, our objective was to build a minimum viable product (MVP) – an API that could autonomously categorize user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial step was to determine suitable categories for feedback. A balance between broad and overly detailed categories would need to be struck. We eventually settled on eight categories, after initially considering more than ten and doing fine tuning over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was the challenge of training our model. The estimate was that we would need approximately 100 reviews per category to showcase the model&amp;#8217;s effectiveness. Combining our efforts, we managed to manually classify sufficient reviews across all categories, hopefully for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Hack Fest was drawing to a close, our ML engineer readied the model and prepared a proof of concept (PoC) site. Despite time constraints, we presented the working model and its potential benefits to our processes. Our project was well-received, even bagging a &lt;a href="https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230621-e066032084/" title="Special Mention"&gt;Special Mention&lt;/a&gt; from one of the judges (Maekawa Miho-san). However, we realized that this success marked merely the beginning of a greater journey towards fully implementing user feedback into our software development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested about Hack Fest and Mercari Culture, check out this related article: &lt;a href="https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230410-b286fe9577/"&gt;https://engineering.mercari.com/en/blog/entry/20230410-b286fe9577/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prd-engineering-asset/2023/10/51e20ea3-voc_qa_process_post.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Template of the reports shared in Slack. This one breaks down the feedback in different categories for teams to work on. Monthly, we would share some graphs as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following months, our model filtered user feedback related to bugs or improvements, assisting in compiling weekly reports. This helped us to quickly evaluate weekly feedback by diving into the reviews that were classified as the categories we cared about the most. We picked out the topics most mentioned by our users and prioritized investigations on them. We also helped prioritize existing tickets with this information. Additionally, we collected improvements laid out by our users to enhance the capabilities of our apps. User input became an essential part of our development process, helping us detect issues and fine-tune features. While we acknowledged the potential to do more with this invaluable tool, we also identified some limitations and areas for future improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Real&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the positive response we received from our weekly reports, there were evident gaps in our process. But, in the spirit of innovation and continuous improvement, we recognized this as an opportunity to refine our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key issue was that stakeholders had limited access to the raw reviews. To address their queries, we had to manually sift through the reports, an exercise that was far from efficient. Similarly, recurrent albeit less common feedback often got overlooked due to its sparse occurrence in our weekly reports. Moreover, our process lacked instant, visually appealing data presentations like graphs, timelines or charts to help quickly comprehend the story behind numbers. Lastly, our not yet mature process had a tendency of duplicating data unnecessarily, a clear area for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen to tackle these pain points, we decided to revolutionize our weekly feedback reports. Our vision was to create an interactive dashboard that allowed stakeholders to access, filter, search, and analyze user feedback data as per their needs. We believed this would help unleash not just the potential of user data but also our team&amp;#8217;s innovative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began the transformation by defining the specifications for the new dashboard. To ensure its efficiency, we created mock data sets for testing and refinement. The upgraded dashboard would now enable users to filter reviews by dates, ratings, categorization, and relevance tags. Realizing the importance of seamless communication, we even integrated a feature for conducting keyword searches in both English and Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping data duplication in check was our next goal. Following several productive discussions, we worked in cohesion with the VoC team and QA to co-own the user reviews data. This allowed us to modify the data without creating redundancies. We also added a &amp;quot;Feature&amp;quot; column as suggested by the VoC team, to clearly highlight which application functionality the feedback pertained to. As part of this journey, we automated some processes previously handled by the VoC team, in collaboration with QA. This teamwork was a testament to Mercari’s collaborative culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prd-engineering-asset/2023/10/e78ad3c0-voc_qa_process_dashboard.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sneak peek of the dashboard we have in place, showing the filtering options available and some basic graphs. Below there’s much more information, insights on ratings trend, preview of the reviews, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the refined data at our disposal, we integrated it with the dashboard, refining as necessary. We were thrilled to roll out our revised weekly reports complete with interactive dashboards. The overwhelming response from Product Development Teams, all roles included, was delightful to witness. Now, our teams could effectively filter and search for keywords related to new features, shedding light on invaluable insights. Empowering our team with this data seemed like a game-changing move and we’re already excited to witness its far-reaching impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvements for the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we glance into the future, we see rooms for optimization and sophistication, even though we have significantly progressed from the days of manually classifying piles of user feedback. The quest for improvement never stops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to augment our efforts in communication can&amp;#8217;t be denied. Engaging as our internal product feedback channel might be, we also acknowledge that we haven&amp;#8217;t roped everyone into it. The key lies in promoting our dashboards and making them more accessible, so that the wealth of insights within can benefit a wider audience. Moreover, a system to ensure that the highlights from our weekly report digests reach the teams who can act upon them directly, is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of opportunities, our sights are set on pouring more data into our ML model pipeline. We strongly believe there is power in volume. By automating more, we can efficiently review additional feedback and take action instead of being bogged down by manual tasks. One promising proposal is to bring back the in-app feedback form. While another involves widening our range to cover feedback from other platforms like SNS. Indeed, our current model may need some fine-tuning for these new data sources, but the potential wealth of unique insights is an exciting prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an alliance with the Customer Support (CS) team feels like a natural progression. CS creates investigations for repeated inquiries about the application behavior, and we do something quite similar for repeated user reviews of our app. We believe a collaboration may pave the way for a unified process or cross-utility of our data sets to boost the quality of the solutions we&amp;#8217;re able to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this journey of continuously refining our approach to harnessing user feedback stands as a testament to our unwavering commitment to quality at Mercari. The narrative underscores the profound impact of collaboration between different teams within the company, as well as the potential for continuous improvement in our delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the initial struggle with overwhelming feedback, the manual categorization of data, to the development of an automated system through our Hack Fest project, we&amp;#8217;ve come a long way in understanding and integrating user feedback. The creation of an interactive dashboard has positively revolutionized our weekly feedback reports, enabling the different teams to efficiently use and discern data. Furthermore, the role the VoC and QA teams played in refining our use of data underscores the richness of diverse collaborations within Mercari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we recognize that our journey is far from over. There remain opportunities for more efficient communication, further data integration, and exploration of fruitful alliances with more teams within the company. As we continue evolving and embracing these opportunities, our aim remains clear: to deliver ever-greater value to the users of our application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing our unique experiences, we hope to spark dialogue and collaboration beyond Mercari&amp;#8217;s walls. The strength of user feedback should never be underestimated. When harnessed effectively, it has the power to transform services, enhance user experience, and prompt targeted enhancements that truly resonate with user needs. As such, it is an invaluable resource in our mission to &amp;quot;circulate all forms of value to unleash the potential in all people”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Joy at Work: How Galwegians Chart Their Professional Destinies</title>
      <link>https://galois.com/blog/2023/10/joy-at-work-how-galwegians-chart-their-professional-destinies/</link>
      <description>**关键词**: Galois，求职，“joy at work”，自我导向，职业发展 

**大纲**:
- “Joy at Work”的核心原则：工作应该是一种深度满足和有意义的来源，我们可以自由地将我们的技能和才能提供给Galois，为Galois和自己共同获益。
- Galois如何促进“joy at work”：允许员工根据自己的兴趣和喜好灵活地指导自己的职业发展，鼓励员工在公司内部转岗发展。
- 根据员工的技能和兴趣与公司的需求进行职业转型。
- 作者的个人经历：从兼职顾问到高级财务分析师的职业发展，展示了自我导向职业发展的案例。
- Galois的核心信念：个人的快乐和专业的成功并不是互斥的，而是相互交织的因素，对于一个有意义的工作经验至关重要。

**总结**:
本文介绍了Galois公司追求“joy at work”的核心原则和实践方法，鼓励员工在工作中追求个人的满足和快乐，并允许他们根据自己的兴趣和能力来自我导向地发展职业。通过作者的个人经历，展示了如何在Galois内部实现职业转型和发展。Galois坚信个人的快乐和专业的成功是相辅相成的，为员工提供了一个充满意义和成就感的工作环境。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of Galois’s core principles is “Seek joy at work.” While that may sound a little fuzzy, we define this principle as follows: “Work should be a source of deep satisfaction and meaning, a place where we can freely offer our skills and talents to the mutual benefit of Galois and ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest ways Galois fosters “joy at work” involves giving Galwegians the ability to chart their own professional destiny—flexibly steering the direction of their career based on their interests and the kinds of tasks that give them joy. Machine learning specialists have learned formal methods and changed the kind of work they do; Research Engineers have discovered a love for project management and become Project Leads; even our General Counsel started out as the front desk manager! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this sort of career transition isn’t done on a whim. To change tacks, a Galwegian’s skills and interests have to match up with an unmet need within the company. But within those parameters, Galois builds from our “joy at work” principle to allow for a remarkable amount of self-direction when it comes to growing and evolving one’s career.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My own story is a great example of what this can look like in action. Over my 15 years at Galois, I went from a part-time consultant to senior financial analyst.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My journey looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where I started:&lt;/strong&gt; Independent Consultant&lt;strong&gt; →&lt;/strong&gt; Part-Time Employee&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, Galois hired me as an independent consultant. Within a year, their contracts department realized they needed help. I had the skill sets they needed and the desire to do the work, so I was hired on as a part-time employee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution round 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Part-Time → Full-Time&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back then, the company was still relatively small, with about a quarter of the employees we have now. Still, there were a lot of operational hats to wear without enough heads to wear them. Since I was already working at Galois part-time, and had already built trust and relationships, it was an easy transition for me to put on a few of those hats that suited me: general office management, continued contracts support, assistance with proposals and costing efforts, and lightweight accounting support. As duties were added, I transitioned from part-time Contract Specialist to full-time Office Coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution round 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Office Coordinator → Offer Building / Proposals Operations&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the company grew, so did the needs in our offer building (the term we use for sales) group, specifically around proposals and forecasting. Since I was already working in and enjoying these tasks as a sub-set of my job, I decided to pursue Proposals Operations as my full time work. This is where I spent the bulk of my years at Galois, working alongside an amazing team of business development experts, principal scientists, and researchers, and having a blast doing it!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution round 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Offer Building / Proposals Operations → Financial Analyst&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After spending a few years in the offer building arena, with the added support for engineering and finance, I’d been exposed to a wide range of overall company operations. It felt like a good time for me to make a shift, and a need was emerging in finance to have a dedicated financial analyst, which perfectly aligned with my career goals. Another win/win!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, my career evolved with my interests and Galois’s needs. When I wanted to try a new and interesting career direction, I didn’t have to leave Galois to do it. I looked for opportunities where my skills and “joy at work” intersected with Galois’s needs, and—over and over again—Galois supported my changing roles to fit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It all comes back to our core belief that personal joy and professional success are not mutually exclusive, but rather intertwined factors that contribute to a fulfilling work experience. For me, those beliefs empowered my career progression, turning “Joy at Work” from an abstract idea into a lived experience that has profoundly shaped my professional journey at Galois.&lt;/p&gt;

  - light-dark函数需要与color-scheme属性一起使用

- 浏览器支持情况
  - 目前Firefox 120支持light-dark函数
  - 预计其他浏览器也将很快支持

**总结：**

该文章介绍了在Web上切换浅色和深色主题的几种方式。可以使用JavaScript或prefers-color-scheme媒体查询根据用户系统偏好切换主题。另外，CSS引入了新的light-dark函数，可以更方便地实现无缝切换，并且可以根据不同属性指定不同的属性值。此外，color-scheme属性可以扩展light-dark函数的使用范围。目前，light-dark函数在Firefox 120中得到支持，希望其他浏览器也会很快支持该功能。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have many ways to switch between light and dark themes on the web. We can use JavaScript to switch between themes or we can use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; media query in CSS to switch between themes based on the user’s system preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="markdown-toc"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/the-new-light-dark-function-to-switch-theme-color-in-css/#the-new-light-dark-function" id="markdown-toc-the-new-light-dark-function"&gt;The new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/the-new-light-dark-function-to-switch-theme-color-in-css/#browser-support" id="markdown-toc-browser-support"&gt;Browser support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; media query lets us do things that would only be applied when light or dark mode is enabled on the user’s system. For instance, you can change the background color of the page to black when the user has enabled dark mode on their system like so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also change the color of the text based on the user’s system preference the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-new-light-dark-function"&gt;The new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to make this all more seamless, CSS is getting &lt;a href="https://www.bram.us/2023/10/09/the-future-of-css-easy-light-dark-mode-color-switching-with-light-dark/"&gt;a new function called&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; which will let you specify two values for a property. The first value will be applied when the user has enabled light mode on their system and the second value will be applied when the user has enabled dark mode on their system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, we don’t need to use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; media query anymore. The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function will take care of that for us. And it’s also more granular as you can specify different values for different properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the user’s theme preference, the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function can also be used to switch between two values based on the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme"&gt;CSS property&lt;/a&gt; allows an element to indicate which color schemes it can comfortably be rendered in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means, for &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; to work, you must also include a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;--text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* In Light Mode = return 1st value. 
  In Dark Mode = return 2nd value. */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; property on a specific element so that it only applies to that element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="browser-support"&gt;Browser support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for browser support, the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function is currently supported in Firefox 120 but hopefully, it will be supported in other browsers soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; function on its specification page &lt;a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#light-dark"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New short story: “Professional Integrity”</title>
      <link>https://blog.rinesi.com/2023/10/new-short-story-professional-integrity/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of your coworkers seem to look forward to the mandatory therapy sessions. You wonder what they talk about with the AI therapist, most often as your session approaches and you have to decide what parts of the truth you&amp;#8217;ll let yourself talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can talk about anything you want. Interactions in a therapy context aren&amp;#8217;t available to your managers and are only used in an anonymized way to monitor the overall health of the company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s only a program. You could ask it if it feels embarrassed for saying something as ridiculous as &amp;#8220;in an anonymized way&amp;#8221;, but it&amp;#8217;d only use that as another input in its modeling. It&amp;#8217;s as incapable of feeling that type of shame as your car software or somebody in marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, you are fairly sure the company and the implant&amp;#8217;s maker lie about the device in your brain not working as a lie detector and the implant happens to be the main thing you don&amp;#8217;t want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&amp;#8217;d feel better if you hadn&amp;#8217;t done therapy before entering the company. You have to, now  &amp;mdash; an FDA requirement for anybody with a cognitively interfaced brain implant &amp;mdash; and restricted to the company&amp;#8217;s own AI &amp;mdash; too many secrets in your head, operational and otherwise; some of them you even know yourself. A good therapy AI, goes the theory, would be able to glean aspects of the implant&amp;#8217;s software based on your response patterns as easily as it can model the rest of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As easily as it can model &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt; Easy mistake to make even in the privacy of your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s private. Your contract says so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You seem anxious lately. What&amp;#8217;s on your mind?&lt;/i&gt; (You want to laugh at the phrasing, don&amp;#8217;t, think the implant registered the intent anyway and informed the AI.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Actaeon deadlines, mostly. It&amp;#8217;s an important project and I know how much it matters to the company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image of a man rendered on your screen nods. &lt;i&gt;Sleep problems aren&amp;#8217;t uncommon in this sort of situation. Have you been sleeping well?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist knows to the minute how much you&amp;#8217;ve been sleeping and when. Better than you know, unless you really haven&amp;#8217;t slept more than an hour or two a day for the last few months. You wouldn&amp;#8217;t put it past the implant&amp;#8217;s capabilities to keep you functional in that situation if not for the fact that if they could do that then it&amp;#8217;d be everybody&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reply that you think you&amp;#8217;ve been sleeping the usual four hours. You used to need six before the implant. Another thing you both know and neither one says aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image nods again and the session ends soon afterward. You are happy to go back to work. You aren&amp;#8217;t always. &lt;i&gt;Motivated,&lt;/i&gt; yes. You haven&amp;#8217;t had once to push yourself to start working ever since you entered the company and got the implant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the company and the implant and everything else you had already done mandatory (read: your father told you to) therapy with a designated therapist (read: the one your father chose and paid for) to address what she ended up describing as episodes of loss of emotional control stemming from environmental stress. &amp;#8220;Environmental stress&amp;#8221; was an euphemism and loss of emotional control was something you were already familiar with &amp;ndash; but until then you had never thought about what it was that you were failing to control. It turned out that minds could have desires they themselves didn&amp;#8217;t know about. It wasn&amp;#8217;t a moral failure but a fact of neural architecture. Everybody had a subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapist didn&amp;#8217;t think dreams were a good window into the subconscious. &lt;i&gt;You are who you are in everything you do. Don&amp;#8217;t worry about decrypting your dreams. Look at what you do. What things are you doing you don&amp;#8217;t know you are doing?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stopped working with her a few years before entering the company. If you could, you would tell her that your dreams have changed since you got the implant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t get a brain scan except in a company-approved clinic. The implant connects to a separate wireless network inside the office and enters a pseudo-Faraday cage mode when you leave. Those aren&amp;#8217;t the only safety measures: the Security department considers external infiltration a serious issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There&amp;#8217;s still a tiny scar on the back of your head where they inserted the implant&amp;#8217;s main mesh and left a small access panel for the annual hardware upgrades.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security hasn&amp;#8217;t forbidden trying to learn about the implant by introspection and self-observation, as if it were a compulsion or trauma. It probably means it&amp;#8217;s useless. You try anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everybody else they hire, you were very good before entering the company and much better afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have more focus. Less of a social life, not that you really had one. You no longer stress about the societal negative externalities of your work. No nightmares about dead children. A great salary. The indescribable feeling of being so good at what you do you don&amp;#8217;t remember the last time you made a mistake or stood still confused about the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI never asks you if you think about quitting. It&amp;#8217;s not that they don&amp;#8217;t want to put the idea in your head. They know you won&amp;#8217;t. You know you won&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s not even the implant,&lt;/i&gt; you think sometimes. The thought makes you feel ill in a different way, but at least you&amp;#8217;re almost sure it&amp;#8217;s yours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CodeSOD: Write, Write Again</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/write-write-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melissa&lt;/strong&gt; was trying to figure out why an old application wasn't writing out a data file when commanded to do so. It was an implemented feature, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work, it &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; worked at one point- but it wasn't working now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She traced through the C code and found this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-c"&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="hljs-title function_"&gt;writeconf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-params"&gt;(&lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
{
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; fd;
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; buf[&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;];
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; len;
    &lt;span class="hljs-type"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; loop;

    &lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;snprintf&lt;/span&gt;(&amp;amp;buf[&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;(buf),&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"%d\n"&lt;/span&gt;, confval);
    &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(loop=&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; loop&amp;lt;&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;; loop++)    &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;//try 10 times to open file&lt;/span&gt;
    {
        fd=open(&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"/tmp/conf"&lt;/span&gt;, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT);
        &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(fd != &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;)
        {
            len=write(fd, &amp;amp;buf[&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;strlen&lt;/span&gt;(buf));
            close(fd);
            &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;  &lt;span class="hljs-comment"&gt;//Ok, ready to exit&lt;/span&gt;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this code is to write a single integer out to &lt;code&gt;/tmp/conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first, we use &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; to write that integer out to a buffer. This line alone piles on the WTFs. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;buf[0]&lt;/code&gt; isn't &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, but it's &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. Arrays in C are pointers to the first object in the array. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;buf[0]&lt;/code&gt; returns a pointer to the first object in the array. &lt;em&gt;They're the same thing&lt;/em&gt;. I don't understand why they went the long way around, unless they didn't understand what arrays are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; doesn't need to be 100 characters long, but that's a minor thing. But the real "yikes" is &lt;code&gt;confval&lt;/code&gt; itself- a global variable accessed from inside this function, which hints at many, many other bad choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we loop. We try to open the file up to ten times. If we fail, we just try again. No waiting, no timeouts, just.. try it ten times, as quick as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we open it, we write the data, again using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;buf[0]&lt;/code&gt; idiom. And… do nothing to check that we successfully wrote anything out. We just hope for the best, close the file descriptor, and exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn't answer &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the file wasn't getting written, but it definitely explained why no one was seeing errors. This doesn't do any meaningful error handling. If it can't open the file, it just gives up after ten tries. If it can't write to the file, it doesn't notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Easy Reader Version: Seriously though, is there some good reason for `&amp;buf[0]` that I don't know about? It seems so intentional, but it makes no sense, and yes, I double checked the spec to make sure there wasn't a gotcha in there that I wasn't thinking about (but only skimmed the section on the subscripting rules, so maybe there's something else out there? MAKE IT MAKE SENSE) --&gt;

**总结：**
Hostinger提供的AI技术驱动的网站构建工具能够根据简短描述自动生成独特的网站，用户只需点击几下即可完成整个过程。新的AI引擎确保每个网站都是独一无二的，并且提供更多样化的布局选择和更完整的页面内容。此外，Hostinger还提供其他AI工具，如AI Writer、AI Heatmap和AI Logo Maker，以帮助用户轻松实现网站开发。使用Hostinger网站构建工具，用户不需要编码或网页设计技能，而且还可以享受免费域名、电子邮件等特点，以确保在线业务的安全性和性能。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;You only need a name, a website type, and a short description to get a website with&lt;strong&gt; AI-powered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/website-builder" rel="follow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hostinger Website Builder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent update ensures that every website AI generates is unique and that the design and content fit the nature of the site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The website creation process remains the same and takes only four clicks. After choosing the &lt;strong&gt;AI Website Builder&lt;/strong&gt;, you just need to describe your business or project.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Website creation with AI Website Builder" class="wp-image-5649" height="613" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/websitebuilder-aibuilder-1024x613.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The AI will automatically prepare the page structure, layout, and mobile view. Then, it will generate your unique content, choose relevant pictures, and perform other technical tasks. While this might sound complicated, &lt;strong&gt;your unique website will be ready in less than a minute&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are unhappy with it, return to the AI form by clicking the corresponding button on the page&amp;#8217;s top-left corner. Refine your request, or don’t even change anything – the newly generated site will still differ from the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Websites generated with Hostinger AI Website Builder." class="wp-image-5650" height="683" src="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/aiwebsitebuilder-generated-websites-1024x683.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once satisfied with the result, personalize the site to your liking. Enter the Full edit mode for complete customization. &lt;strong&gt;Change colors and fonts, drag and drop page elements, add, remove, or switch sections, and make other adjustments&lt;/strong&gt; to get the website you want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-advantages-of-the-new-ai-engine"&gt;Advantages of the New AI Engine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our earlier AI integration used several predefined templates and added relevant content to them. In some cases, websites were very similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new AI engine generates a sitemap of website pages and their sections. It then injects a suitable variation for each of the sections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;AI uses the same framework to create a new, unique website&lt;/strong&gt; for every request it gets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This way, every blog, online portfolio, or business showcase generated by AI differs. The advantages are threefold:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger variety of site layouts&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re also working on more design options to expand the choice even further.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The same website type can cover more use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; With a Business showcase type, a restaurant website can now have a separate menu section, and a personal coach site can include an appointment section.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Websites are much more complete. &lt;/strong&gt;The relevant pages are generated based on the initial description, and additional ones can be added anytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-ai-tools-in-hostinger-website-builder"&gt;More AI Tools in Hostinger Website Builder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI builder is one of several &lt;strong&gt;AI tools&lt;/strong&gt; in Hostinger Website Builder. Here’s how AI can make web development easier and more efficient:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Writer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Describe your idea, and get unique, compelling, and SEO-friendly content. It can generate any kind of content, including blog posts, pages, or even product descriptions, to boost your SEO performance and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Heatmap&lt;/strong&gt;. Analyze your website’s design and structure to predict user behavior. By using the heatmap, you can adjust the layout, font sizes, images, buttons, and other design elements so that visitors notice exactly what you want to show them first.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Logo Maker&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Upscale your visual identity with a captivating logo. Share your brand name and slogan, describe your ideal logo, and choose a design from the AI-generated options. Just a few clicks, and you can start using your new logo everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-hostinger-website-builder-benefits"&gt;Other Hostinger Website Builder Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best part of using Hostinger Website Builder is that you &lt;strong&gt;don’t need coding or web design skills&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone can create a website, including a business site, a portfolio, or an online store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell online&lt;/strong&gt; without additional transaction fees and optimize campaigns with &lt;strong&gt;integrated marketing tools&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Create and edit websites with your smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s all included.

      <description>**关键词：**
1. 聊天GPT（ChatGPT）
2. Copilot
3. Codex
4. LLM工具
5. 技术面试

**大纲：**
- 聊天GPT、Copilot和Codex等工具的介绍和应用。
- 使用这些工具进行实时编码面试的影响和挑战。
- 在技术面试中评估使用这些工具的候选人的方法和问题。
- 没有解决面试中使用工具的问题对候选人和公司带来的影响。
- 未来的技术面试趋势和对面试过程的改进。

**总结：**
本文讨论了在聊天GPT、Copilot、Codex等工具的流行和广泛应用下，如何在技术面试中评估候选人使用这些工具的能力。未解决这个问题可能导致无法评估候选人的真正能力，从而影响招聘的质量。文章提出了评估使用这些工具的候选人的方法，并展望了未来技术面试的发展趋势。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FcHc33-5Mg3PjxFoxtOtsw.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image generated by using the title of this article&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of ChatGPT, Copilot, Codex, and other tools makes it easier to code but also makes it easier to answer live coding interviews unless we do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OLX, we promote the use of a tool called &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110901049833439234?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7110901049833439234%29"&gt;PlusOne&lt;/a&gt;, which is an internal LLM tool made to help us code, coach ourselves, and more. This reveals an interesting gap, which is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If OLX promotes the use of a tool once you are hired, why when hiring are we not evaluating people based on using these tools effectively?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of not addressing this is that people who can’t adapt to the use of these tools will surely lag behind other engineers, and their performance will suffer. We will only be able to notice this after a few months, and it is better to notice that as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those who are not aware: ChatGPT is a Large Language Model able to generate code if you give it a problem statement and the platform+language it should use. Copilot is a tool from Github that can autocomplete large amounts of code, e.g. writing unit tests. Codex is a similar LLM tool from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we saw two interview candidates using Copilot/Codex during a live coding interview. While we talked about the possibility of that happening during our interviewer's sync, we were not really prepared to evaluate candidates if they use those, compared to candidates who don’t use them. Because of this, I was interested to know the latest on the:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allowing the usage of Copilot/LLMs during live coding interviews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case of allowing it, evaluating candidates that use them during the interview&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the case of not allowing it, evaluating if they know how to use these tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will be exploring what happens if we don’t act on this, what can be done to adjust to the new normal, and what is the view of the future in tech interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Related Work&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other articles discussed this topic. This &lt;a href="https://blog.expertlead.com/how-ai-driven-chatbots-like-chatgpt-are-affecting-the-way-of-doing-tech-assessments"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; talks about the critical thinking and creativity skills that cannot be taken away by the AI tools that are provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dawn-ai-coding-rethinking-engineering-interview-vidal-graupera/"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; article, Vidal talks about how soft skills become more important in the light of these tools that help with generating code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pair+programming+with+llm&amp;amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enDE996DE996&amp;amp;oq=pair+programming+with+llm&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgcIAhAAGKIE0gEIMzU0OWowajSoAgCwAgA&amp;amp;hl=en-GB&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; on how to pair program with a LLM was published in collaboration with Google. This shows some basics of how to use a LLM while writing code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not addressing what to do on this topic will lead to a couple of scenarios&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Candidates will not be able to show their full potential during interviews when we don’t allow them to use the Copilot that they are used to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will get candidates who we are not sure if they can’t learn to work with these tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We get less time evaluating their critical thinking skills due to setting up code, downloading dependencies, or a slow machine, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will not be able to find candidates who work very well with these tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These all impact the quality of hires by decreasing success rates for people who cannot use LLM tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of not allowing these tools. We are going to be falling back into the age of interviews before these tools existed. People rely on their own problem-solving skills, and the amount of output they generate during live coding interviews is limited by their machine’s speed in compilation and their ability to debug quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case we allow the copilot tools, there would be less effort in generating the initial code to allow developers to start quickly. There are multiple cases that could happen based on how good the Copilot/LLM tools they use are, in decreasing order of help from the Copilot/LLM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They don’t have access to these tools. In this case, we fall back to classical interviewing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Copilot generates the whole solution for them, with no need to edit/debug, and it already covers the edge cases we would be throwing at them. We would only be able to evaluate their prompt engineering skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Copilot generates code that works for the normal cases and is missing edge cases. We would be able to evaluate their prompt engineering skills, their code review skills, their ability to identify edge cases, and their ability to adapt the code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Copilot generates a barely working code that doesn’t meet the requirements. They would have to correct the LLM to guide it to a working solution like the case above. Or they would have to break down the problem so that the tool can help them with some parts of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cases reveal some of the (new) key concepts that we need to pay attention to when evaluating candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting of technical coding interview from pure code generation to prompt engineering plus code review plus refactoring (of course, also debugging and testing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. they would write the problem in a form that LLM understands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Review&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. to find edge cases and see if the code works as intended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. changing the architecture of the generated code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. if the generated code doesn’t work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; — e.g. to confirm that the generated code works in various cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to assess the seniority of the person using these key concepts, we also have to benchmark what a junior vs mid vs senior interviewee would look like. For example, a Senior Engineer would be able to identify more edge cases or would be able to explain the engineering choices that the tool made and maybe explain what happens to these decisions if the assumptions change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View of the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Coding interviews are a way to test how someone would perform in a real-life situation in a short amount of time using a controlled environment. Some tradeoffs in this process are the amount of time and the accuracy and granularity of evaluation that we are able to make during this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by a &lt;a href="https://www.offerzen.com/events/offerzen-events/untold-stories-in-tech-hiring/do-more-with-less-futureproof-technical-assessments-with-ai"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; I heard before that mentions that, ideally, we would also include working together with the team to evaluate a real-life situation where people are working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the interview process would involve people from the team and a Copilot-like tool, which mirrors how a normal working day looks like. The problem with this approach is that it uses a lot of time from the interviewers. In the current view of things, we already have this problem of Engineers spending a lot of time on interviews, which is mitigated by limiting the time per week that is allocated to this. We also treat interviewing as part of Senior Engineer responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While using LLMs won’t replace our technical skills, it will definitely add to our suite of second-brain tools like Google Search, Stackoverflow, or our own notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there will still be some time until companies adapt to allowing these tools or being able to evaluate people who use these AI tools during live coding interviews. The call to action is for us to start talking about how to evaluate them. Otherwise, we won’t be able to have people who can’t work with these tools and will be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be diving deeper into this topic and how to transition from the classical technical interview process in another article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=4e09553bb117" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tech.olx.com/live-coding-interviews-in-the-era-of-llms-4e09553bb117"&gt;Live Coding Interviews in the Era of LLMs&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://tech.olx.com"&gt;OLX Engineering&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

**总结：**
本文介绍了在游戏开发中与软件咨询公司建立合作伙伴关系的潜力。通过合作伙伴关系能够加速项目的推进并提供多样化的技能和服务。软件咨询公司不仅能够帮助开发团队加快上市时间，还能通过协作优势提高生产力。他们的技能包括快速开发和部署用户生成内容平台、伴随应用和门户、游戏用户界面和企业设计系统、用户体验设计、人工智能驱动的分析和个性化以及战略化的盈利与用户激励等方面。通过与合适的软件咨询公司合作，可以最大限度地发挥游戏的潜力并取得成功。 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a decision-maker on a game development team, you&amp;#8217;re no stranger to the ever-changing dynamics of the gaming industry. Here, time-to-market is not just a catchphrase but a critical metric. The constant demand for new and engaging content means game developers, large and small, often face immense pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve probably engaged with traditional industry partnerships. But, have you ever considered teaming up with a software consultancy as your g&lt;span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"&gt;ame co-development partner? It might be time you did, and here&amp;#8217;s why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case Study: Pixelberry Studios and Atomic Object&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year and a half, I&amp;#8217;ve been immersed in an exciting project, bringing my skills as a software designer to a collaborative effort between Atomic Object and Pixelberry. (&lt;a href="https://atomicobject.com/portfolio/pixelberry-digital-storytelling-platform"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can read more about the project here!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) Pixelberry looked beyond the usual suspects for partners and came to Atomic Object, a software consultancy. Theirs was a large ask — create an immersive User Generated Content Platform from the ground up. We helped them deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our parent company gave us one year and asked us if we could go big,” said David Robinson, Director of Production at StoryLoom. “We asked the Atomic team, ‘We want to go big — can you go on this journey with us?’ and they said, ‘Yeah, we’ll get on that ship with you!’ They didn’t flinch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a dynamic team comprising fellow design and software consultants from Atomic Object and key stakeholders at Pixelberry, we poured our collective knowledge and passion into crafting &lt;a href="https://storyloom.com/"&gt;StoryLoom,&lt;/a&gt; a cross-platform experience for mobile and desktop where the community can play, build, and publish interactive story games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixelberry and Atomic collaborated throughout the g&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ame development pipeline. Using Figma and focusing on value-driven, lean UX, we embarked on designing an enterprise-level design system and applied it to create an end-to-end user experience. From creating a cross-platform architecture to building custom content authoring tools for interactive story publishing, we delivered beyond the role of traditional software development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was completed on time and budget, delivering a feature-rich, engaging platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They are laser-focused on budget and timing, which is something I&amp;#8217;ve never seen in 30 years of development,&amp;#8221; said David Robinson. &amp;#8220;It was delivered on time, on budget, to expectation, live—not three or four milestones late with people leaving and the platform half-baked and full of bugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome included an innovative set of creator tools within the &lt;a href="https://storyloom.com/"&gt;StoryLoom&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem, including a user-friendly, no-code story builder, a dynamic character creator, a creator economy, and a custom admin experience. The most rewarding moment was when we finally reached our goal together and launched an open beta for the storytelling community in just 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience has led me to think more about how software and game companies might team up to produce innovative products. This is not because it&amp;#8217;s my job, but because I have a passion for games and would genuinely love to see more projects in this intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software Consultancies: Empower Your Gaming Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a reason Pixelberry chose to partner with Atomic to create a proof of concept, and eventually ship a cross-platform application for web and mobile. Here are some advantages I believe software companies like Atomic bring to the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#8217;re very versatile!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software consultancy is not just a dev shop. We&amp;#8217;re extensions of your team and bring &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/08/22/generalist-makers-the-unicorns-of-the-software-industry/"&gt;diverse services and experiences&lt;/a&gt; to the table. &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/tag/generalist-makers/"&gt;Generalist makers&lt;/a&gt; have a wide range of skills, from &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/07/18/mobile-phone-statistics/"&gt;product strategy&lt;/a&gt; and UX Design to API integrations and analytics. One of our key strengths is that we bring best practices and lessons learned from other sectors like healthcare and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We can help accelerate your go-to-market strategy.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/08/04/sprint-planning/"&gt;agile methodologies&lt;/a&gt;, consultancies can help streamline your roadmap and processes. From the first idea to beta, and even after the big launch, a high-performing, dedicated team can be essential. They&amp;#8217;ll help you move and scale fast without missing important milestones along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#8217;re pros at collaboration.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software consultants can effortlessly blend into your existing setup. Whether you need them to &lt;a href="https://atomicobject.com/client-resources/select-software-development-partner"&gt;lead or simply supplement your team&lt;/a&gt;, their contribution will level up your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3656846" height="1080" src="https://spin.atomicobject.com/wp-content/uploads/3.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Software Consultancies Offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most software consultancies don&amp;#8217;t specialize in game production for game engines like Unity, our teams share much of the same development skills. We&amp;#8217;re also both versed in designing and engineering services like those that support gameplay and the larger player experience.&lt;br /&gt;
User-Generated Content Platforms &amp;#8211; Skill sets in JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular translate to rapid development and deployment of UGC platforms. This can supercharge co-creation and community engagement, and incentivize players to create value in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companion Apps and Portals&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you envision your game sharing real-time data with a companion app? &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/08/28/server-sent-events/"&gt;Modern APIs and WebSocket technology&lt;/a&gt; can make this a reality. Using these tools, you can offer players a seamless experience, from in-game to secondary screens. Create a more immersive experience by enabling player personalization and customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game UI and Enterprise Design Systems&lt;/strong&gt;. A cohesive design language across platforms is more than eye candy. It’s essential for brand continuity, and this is where software designers excel. Implementing flexible and scalable &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/11/23/figma-reusable-complex-components/"&gt;design systems&lt;/a&gt; encourages a consistent look and feel across complex game ecosystems. Implementing reusable &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/06/22/reusable-react-components/"&gt;components&lt;/a&gt;, modules, and &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/07/19/typescript-federated-modules/"&gt;microfrontends&lt;/a&gt; helps create an easily scalable foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Experience (UX) Design&lt;/strong&gt;. Software designers are adept at crafting user-centric experiences. Leveraging insights from user research and analytics, like methods used in Player Experience (PX) Design, they can help fine-tune in-game interactions to optimize enjoyment, engagement, and retention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Powered Analytics and Personalization&lt;/strong&gt;. Integration of machine learning can elevate your game by introducing features like predictive analytics and personalized player experiences. Software consultants experienced in AI integrations can identify new opportunities for increasing player engagement, player retention, or &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;average revenue per user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Monetization and User Incentives&lt;/strong&gt;. A software consultancy&amp;#8217;s expertise isn&amp;#8217;t limited to development and design. They can also construct secure, transparent in-game economies and strategies to incentivize player engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting a partner to co-develop your game or app is an enduring commitment. And, in a world where game companies are constantly racing against the clock, augmentation through a strategic team partnership can be your game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3656845" height="1080" src="https://spin.atomicobject.com/wp-content/uploads/2-1.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is knowing if you&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="https://atomicobject.com/client-resources/choosing-the-right-software-development-partner"&gt;choosing the right partner&lt;/a&gt;. You don&amp;#8217;t just need more people. Instead, you need the right people who can go beyond traditional roles to deliver results and truly augment your own capabilities. A software consultancy can be your unexplored avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t limit your scope. Consider software consultancies like Atomic Object in your &lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/06/17/software-partner-estimations/"&gt;selection process&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#8217;ll get more than just additional hands; you gain strategic partners committed to your game&amp;#8217;s success. Let&amp;#8217;s unlock your game&amp;#8217;s full potential, together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Add Dark Mode in ReactJS Using Material UI</title>
      <link>https://semaphoreci.com/blog/dark-mode-reactjs-material-ui</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Material UI framework is an open-source user interface framework for React that follows the principles of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://m3.material.io/"&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s Material Design&lt;/a&gt;. It offers a variety of components allowing developers to create appealing and user-friendly interfaces, without starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Material Design prioritizes a consistent user interface with attention given to elements like light, shadow, and motion effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make our application more visually appealing we will learn how to code a Dark Mode feature for our application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can combine the Material UI framework with React to create a Dark Mode of our web applications. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of adding Dark Mode to a React application using Material UI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dark Mode, also known as night mode or darkness theme refers to an option in the user interface design where the content, on the screen is presented in colors compared to the illumination mode. When you activate the mode the background color typically appears as black or dark while the text and user interface elements are displayed in colors that create a striking contrast, between the foreground and background.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s now find out how to add Dark mode in React using Material UI (MUI).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-setting-up-a-react-project"&gt;Setting up a React Project&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we need to set up a React project first. Here&amp;#8217;s how you can get started:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-prerequisites"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you have Node.js and npm (node package manager) installed on your system before we start to implement Dark Mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-installation-of-required-dependencies"&gt;Installation of required dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To install Node.js, visit the Node.js&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/current"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, and download the current version of it according to your operating system. After that just follow the installation steps to complete the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the Node.js is installed, check whether the node.js version is properly installed by running the given command in your command line terminal:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;node –version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the Node is installed correctly, we can proceed further to add the dark mode functionality in React using MUI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-creating-a-new-react-project"&gt;Creating a new React project&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We typically create the react app using the traditional method i.e., using Create React App (CRA), but it can take a lot of time to install the required dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vite &amp;#8211; a new frontend tool that saves the time in creating a react application. So, now instead of using CRA, we are going to use Vite:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the following command in your terminal to start working with Vite:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm create vite@latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Follow the prompts to enter your project name, framework, and a variant:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;Need to install the following packages:
  create-vite@4.4.1
Ok to proceed? (y) y

✔ Project name: ... my-react-project
✔ Select a framework: » React
✔ Select a variant: » JavaScript&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, navigate to your project directory using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd my-react-project&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, use the npm command to install the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-configuring-material-ui-in-the-project"&gt;Configuring Material UI in the project&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To integrate Material UI into your React app, you need to install the Material UI core package and its styles. These come in three packages:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-start-the-development-server"&gt;Start the development server&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we will start our development server to test whether everything is properly implemented and is working.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will see the following output:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;VITE v4.4.9  ready in 943 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To see the output, visit &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:5173/&lt;/code&gt; where the default react project is running:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-21888" height="818" src="https://wpblog.semaphoreci.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f48467a316f526b2e706e67.png" width="1011" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-implement-dark-mode-using-material-ui-in-reactjs"&gt;Implement Dark Mode using Material UI in ReactJS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adding the dark mode feature in a React application involves instatiating a ThemeProvider to handle dark and light themes and adding a switch to change between modes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-enabling-dark-mode-using-material-uis-themeprovider-component"&gt;Enabling Dark Mode using Material UI&amp;#8217;s ThemeProvider component&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Material UI provides a theme provider component called ThemeProvider that will allow themes to be defined and used in the app. The ThemeProvider tool allows for a dynamic switch from light to dark themes when implementing the Dark mode. You may create two separate themes when using a Dark mode, one for Light Mode and the other for Dark Mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can use the ThemeProvider service to place components of your application into a package and switch among these themes according to user preferences or special events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To enable the dark mode, we need to create a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;darkTheme&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;createTheme&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;utility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For applying the dark theme to entire application, we will wrap all our main content into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;component, ensuring that all components within it follow the defined theme, creating a consistent and visually appealing user interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now go to the &lt;code&gt;src/App.js&lt;/code&gt; file in your project and replace the existing code of the file with the following example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;// App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";

import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";

export default function App() {

  // create a darkTheme function to handle dark theme using createTheme
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      mode: darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light',
    },
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
	// other code goes here…
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code, apart from using just the ThemeProvider, we also use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;CssBaseline&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to use the full set of Global CSS Styles in your applications. The inclusion of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;CssBaseline&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is required for ensuring coherent image experience in both light as well as darkness modes when implementing this mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once, you are done with the above step, you can now create a separate dark theme with different colors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-creating-a-separate-dark-theme"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a separate dark theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To customize the dark theme for multiple components in the application, you can modify it by defining the primary, and secondary colors and other properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Replace the existing palette colors with the following example code in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;after the imports and before&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;export default function App()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js

export default function App() {

// applying the primary and secondary theme colors
const darkTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: 'dark', //default theme
    primary: {
      main: '#90caf9',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#f48fb1',
    },
   // add other properties here…
  },
});

  ...

  return(
    ...
  )

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the complete&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;setup, your entire app will now use the dark theme by default. But what if we want to toggle between light and dark themes? We will do it next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-toggling-dark-mode"&gt;Toggling Dark Mode&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To give your users a way to toggle between different theme modes, you can add React&amp;#8217;s context to a button&amp;#8217;s onChange event, as shown in the following demo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-creating-a-switch-or-button-to-toggle-between-light-and-dark-mode"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a switch or button to toggle between light and dark mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To toggle between the light and dark modes in a React app, we need to add a switch button to it. Adding a switch can be done by importing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;Component from Material UI and then defining it in the App component.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For defining a switch, we can simply add the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;component between the ThemeProvider tags. We&amp;#8217;re going to add a div, a card with example content and the switch to change the theme:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js 

export default function App() {

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    ...
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;

        //Adding the switch button
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={darkMode} onChange={toggleSwitchFunction} /&gt;
         ...
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you have added the Switch button, let’s define the toggle states so that the switch can toggle the dark or light theme. Below is how we can define the states using the &lt;code&gt;useState()&lt;/code&gt; hook in React.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js 

export default function App() {

  // state to manage the dark mode
  const [toggleDarkMode, setToggleDarkMode] = useState(true);

  // function to toggle the dark mode as true or false
  const toggleDarkTheme = () =&gt; {
    setToggleDarkMode(!toggleDarkMode);
  };

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    ...
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&gt;Toggle Dark mode&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={toggleDarkMode} onChange={toggleDarkTheme} /&gt;
         ...
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we have first imported all the required components from React and MUI, after which inside the main App component, we have initialized a state variable&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;toggleDarkMode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;where the initial value is set to true, indicating the dark theme is currently active. With the variable, we have also defined a function to update the state called&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;setToggleDarkMode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will add our card example to switch the theme and if you have followed all the steps correctly your App.js should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js file

import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";
import { Card, CardContent, CardMedia, Switch, Typography } from "@mui/material"

export default function App() {

  // state to manage the dark mode
  const [toggleDarkMode, setToggleDarkMode] = useState(true);

  // function to toggle the dark mode as true or false
  const toggleDarkTheme = () =&gt; {
    setToggleDarkMode(!toggleDarkMode);
  };

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      mode: 'light',
      primary: {
        main: '#90caf9',
      },
      secondary: {
        main: '#131052',
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&gt;Toggle Dark mode&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={toggleDarkMode} onChange={toggleDarkTheme} /&gt;
        &amp;lt;Card sx={{ width: '30%', borderRadius: 3, padding: 1 }}&gt;
          &amp;lt;CardContent&gt;
            &amp;lt;CardMedia sx={{ height: 180, borderRadius: 3 }} image="https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg" title="semaphore" /&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="h4" component="div" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}&gt;
              Programming Blogs
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }} color="text.secondary"&gt;
              by Semaphore
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="body1"&gt;
              Checkout the latest blogs on Semaphore. Semaphore provides you the best CI/CD solution
              for high-performance engineering teams.
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
          &amp;lt;/CardContent&gt;
        &amp;lt;/Card&gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you run the above code, you will notice that the toggle doesn’t change the theme to dark or light, as we haven’t added the state to update the theme dynamically, it will display a light theme by default.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we will see how we can handle the state of the dark mode toggle and update it dynamically by toggling the switch button based on the dark mode state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-handling-the-state-of-the-dark-mode-toggle-updating-the-theme-dynamically-based-on-the-dark-mode-state"&gt;Handling the state of the Dark Mode toggle, updating the theme dynamically based on the Dark Mode state&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You noticed that when we switch on the button, it doesn’t change the theme, it is because the state is not being handled to update the theme dynamically. We now see how we can update the theme dynamically based on the dark mode state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To switch the theme dynamically, we are going to render a conditional condition in the &lt;code&gt;darkTheme&lt;/code&gt; mode within our App.js file as given below:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;const darkTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: toggleDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light', 
    ...
  },
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, If you have followed all the steps correctly, your App.js will finally look like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;//App.js

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";
import { Card, CardContent, CardMedia, Switch, Typography } from "@mui/material"

export default function App() {

  // state to manage the dark mode
  const [toggleDarkMode, setToggleDarkMode] = useState(true);

  // function to toggle the dark mode as true or false
  const toggleDarkTheme = () =&gt; {
    setToggleDarkMode(!toggleDarkMode);
  };

  // applying the primary and secondary theme colors
  const darkTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      mode: toggleDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light', // handle the dark mode state on toggle
      primary: {
        main: '#90caf9',
      },
      secondary: {
        main: '#131052',

      },
    },
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}&gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
      &amp;lt;div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&gt;Toggle Dark mode&amp;lt;/h2&gt;
        &amp;lt;Switch checked={toggleDarkMode} onChange={toggleDarkTheme} /&gt;
        {/* rendering the card component with card content */}
        &amp;lt;Card sx={{ width: '30%', borderRadius: 3, padding: 1 }}&gt;
          &amp;lt;CardContent&gt;
            &amp;lt;CardMedia sx={{ height: 180, borderRadius: 3 }} image="https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg" title="semaphore" /&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="h4" component="div" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}&gt;
              Programming Blogs
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography sx={{ mb: 1.5 }} color="text.secondary"&gt;
              by Semaphore
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
            &amp;lt;Typography variant="body1"&gt;
              Checkout the latest blogs on Semaphore. Semaphore provides you the best CI/CD solution
              for high-performance engineering teams.
            &amp;lt;/Typography&gt;
          &amp;lt;/CardContent&gt;
        &amp;lt;/Card&gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&gt;
  )
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the given code, we have used conditional rendering in the palette mode to dynamically update the dark mode theme in React. We have assigned the value of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;toggleDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light'&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;property which indicates that when&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;toggleDarkMode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is true, the theme&amp;#8217;s mode is set to &amp;#8216;dark&amp;#8217;, else it will be set to &amp;#8216;light&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-run-the-application"&gt;Run the application&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we have successfully learned how we can add the dark mode functionality in React using Material UI, let’s see the output of the above program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To run the application of react, in your terminal run the below command:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code has-font-down-2-font-size"&gt;&lt;code class=""&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Go to localhost:port, and see the output. The output of the given code will look like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-21889" height="520" src="https://wpblog.semaphoreci.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f71524f437161352e706e67.gif" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s all folks! Now, you have successfully learned the complete process to add dark mode in React using Material UI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-content-conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you&amp;#8217;ve gained an understanding of how to add dark mode into React using Material UI. By integrating a dark theme you can enhance the user experience by providing an appealing and eye-friendly alternative theme.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The step-by-step instructions outlined in the tutorial make it easy for you to seamlessly set up and switch between light modes giving your users a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing interface.

And just as financial services experiences its cycles, this time of year I find myself returning to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/does-cost-reduction-play-a-role-in-digital-transformation/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;topic of cost reduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Financial services institutions are constantly challenged to strike the delicate balance between innovation and cost-saving as they seek out opportunities to decrease expenses while funding new application development projects. Historically, firms have relied on high-cost, third-party solutions to help identify savings opportunities, however, the landscape is rapidly changing, and the emergence of AI and machine learning (ML) has ushered in a new era of possibilities. These cutting-edge technologies provide lower-cost alternatives for discovering efficiencies within financial operations, all while enhancing the quality of services offered. In this dynamic environment, harnessing the power of AI and ML is proving to be a game-changer for firms seeking to thrive in an increasingly competitive market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The use cases for these technologies continue to expand and improve, shaping the industry in ways we could only dream of. In fact, some of the insights presented in this blog have been assisted by the power of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the synergy between human expertise and AI-driven insights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this year’s post, I’ve collected cost-reduction strategies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;augmented by the capabilities of generative AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and innovative approaches that promise to accelerate cost-reduction and reshape the financial services landscape in the year ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;New technology means new opportunities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;AI generally and ML, generative AI, and LLMs specifically, have the potential to significantly reduce costs for financial services at large by automating tasks, improving productivity, and reducing the need for manual labor. And by investing in these technologies, companies gain the added benefits of increasing competitive advantage and improving customer experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Although this list is not exhaustive, I’ve provided an at-a-glance aggregate of use cases for quick wins, quicker wins, and longer-term strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) and Chatbots&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Chatbots, or virtual assistants powered by generative AI, can be used to create customer-facing and employee-facing tools that assess user requests and provide personalized responses, reducing the need for human representatives and related costs. They can provide instant and accurate responses to common customer queries such as account balance, transaction history, loan information, and general banking procedures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;An EKB can be used to assist employees in accessing accurate and up-to-date product, regulatory compliance, and internal IT support information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Research and Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automate the process of gathering, analyzing, and reporting financial data and market trends, reducing the time and cost of manual research for faster decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Analyze a portfolio of investments and identify opportunities to optimize returns while managing risk. This can help investors reduce the time and cost of manual portfolio management and potentially improve investment performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Generation, Text Classification, and Clustering&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automate website content for FAQs and help sections, keeping customer-facing content up to date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automatically create personalized messages, account statements, and transaction summaries, and notify customers of upcoming events or offers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Group customers based on their transaction history, demographics, behavior patterns, and other relevant data to improve marketing and personalization outcomes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Detect patterns and indicators of potential fraudulent activities using transaction data, customer profiles, and other relevant information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quick wins!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal and Compliance&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarizing regulatory requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;AI can summarize regulatory requirements by analyzing large volumes of regulatory texts and extracting key information, making it easier for financial services firms to understand and comply with complex regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating compliance monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Analyzing and interpreting regulatory texts is time consuming, but AI can automate these tasks to help financial services firms understand and comply with complex regulations, saving time and costs associated with manual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;compliance monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing regulatory change management:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Financial services firms must stay up to date with regulatory changes by monitoring and analyzing regulatory updates. AI can enable them to quickly adapt their compliance processes and reduce the risk of non-compliance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving regulatory reporting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; AI can automate the process of generating regulatory reports, ensuring accuracy and consistency while reducing the time and effort required for manual reporting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expedited legal research:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generative AI tools can quickly search and analyze relevant case law, legislation, and secondary sources, enabling legal professionals to access pertinent information with ease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quickest wins!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Translation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilingual customer service:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;With generative AI, customer support representatives can communicate effectively with customers who may not speak the bank&amp;#8217;s primary language. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document translation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; When collaborating with multinational groups, generative AI can translate contracts, agreements, policies, and other legal/ business documents ensuring accurate written communication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Development and Testing Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code generation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;One of the benefits of generative AI is that it can be used to generate code automatically, reducing the time and effort required by developers. By analyzing existing code and patterns, generative AI algorithms can generate new code that is optimized for specific use cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Generative AI can be used to generate test cases automatically, reducing the time and effort required for developers to test their code. By analyzing the code and identifying potential edge cases, generative AI algorithms can generate test cases that cover a wide range of scenarios.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Identifying and fixing bugs in code is essential for application security. By analyzing the code and identifying potential issues, generative AI algorithms can suggest fixes that can be implemented by developers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;By analyzing the code and identifying potential optimizations, generative AI can update code automatically, improving performance and reducing resource usage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthetic data generation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generative AI can generate synthetic data for testing purposes and for training machine learning models, helping developers improve the accuracy of their models and make more informed decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated documentation generation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generating documentation is time consuming and tedious. AI can automatically generate documentation as developers write code, reducing the need for manual documentation while improving efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code comments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Generative AI can be used to generate code comments that describe the function and purpose of each element of the code, helping developers identify inconsistencies or potential sources of errors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding legacy code:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Generative AI can be used to analyze and understand the structure and functionality of legacy code, making it easier for developers to work with and maintain, including:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generating unit tests:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Automatically generate unit tests for legacy code, helping developers identify and fix potential issues and improve code quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code refactoring:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Assist in refactoring legacy code by suggesting improvements and identifying potential sources of bugs or inefficiencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translating legacy code to modern languages:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Translate legacy code written in outdated languages, such as COBOL, to more modern languages, making it easier to maintain and integrate with newer systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Utilizing AI and its related technologies for cost reduction may seem like a huge lift, but the opportunities in financial services are many, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/generative-ai-for-the-enterprise/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;overcoming the perceived challenges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is getting easier every day.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These engineers typically have some high level metrics about their network traffic, but they struggle to collect essential information on the specific traffic flows that would clarify the issue. To solve this problem, Cloudflare has been piloting a cloud network flow monitoring product called &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; that gives customers end-to-end visibility into all traffic across their network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Cloudflare is excited to announce that Magic Network Monitoring (previously called &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/flow-based-monitoring-for-magic-transit/"&gt;Flow Based Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;) is now generally available to all enterprise customers. Over the last year, the Cloudflare engineering team has significantly improved Magic Network Monitoring; we’re excited to offer a network services product that will help our customers identify threats faster, reduce vulnerabilities, and make their network more secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring is automatically enabled for all Magic Transit and Magic WAN enterprise customers. The product is located at the account level of the Cloudflare dashboard and can be opened by navigating to “Analytics &amp;amp; Logs &amp;gt; Magic Monitoring”. The onboarding process for Magic Network Monitoring is self-serve, and all enterprise customers with access can begin configuring the product today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any enterprise customers without Magic Transit or Magic WAN that are interested in testing Magic Network Monitoring can receive access to the free version (with some &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/magic-network-monitoring-free/"&gt;limitations&lt;/a&gt; on traffic volume) by submitting a request to their Cloudflare account team or filling out this form to &lt;a href="http://network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;talk with an expert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-magic-network-monitoring"&gt;What is Magic Network Monitoring?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring is a cloud network flow monitor. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_flow_(computer_networking)"&gt;Network traffic flow&lt;/a&gt; refers to any stream of packets between one source and one destination with the same Internet protocol and set of ports. Customers can send network flow reports from their routers (or any other network flow generator) to a publicly available endpoint on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/"&gt;Cloudflare’s anycast network&lt;/a&gt;, even if the traffic didn’t originally pass through Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare analyzes the network flow data, then provides customers visibility into key network traffic metrics via an analytics dashboard. These metrics include: traffic volume (in bits or packets) over time, source IPs, destination IPs, ports, traffic protocols, and router IPs. Customers can also configure alerts to identify &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;DDoS attacks&lt;/a&gt; and any other abnormal traffic volume activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="802" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/1-1.png" width="1435" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Send flow data from your network to Cloudflare for analysis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="enterprise-ddos-attack-type-detection"&gt;Enterprise DDoS attack type detection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/on-demand/"&gt;Magic Transit On Demand&lt;/a&gt; (MTOD) customers will experience significant traffic visibility benefits when using Magic Network Monitoring. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/"&gt;Magic Transit&lt;/a&gt; is a network security solution that offers DDoS protection and traffic acceleration from every Cloudflare data center for on-premise, cloud-hosted, and hybrid networks. Magic Transit On Demand customers can activate Magic Transit for protection when a DDoS attack is detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, we noticed that some MTOD customers lacked the network visibility tools to quickly identify DDoS attacks and take the appropriate mitigation action. Now, MTOD customers can use Magic Network Monitoring to analyze their network data and receive an alert if a DDoS attack is detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="761" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/2-1.png" width="1436" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cloudflare detects a DDoS attack from the customer’s network flow data&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a DDoS attack is detected, Magic Network Monitoring customers can choose to either manually or automatically enable Magic Transit to mitigate any DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="761" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/3-1.png" width="1436" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Activate Magic Transit for DDoS protection&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="enterprise-network-monitoring"&gt;Enterprise network monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s Magic WAN and Cloudflare One customers can also benefit from using Magic Network Monitoring. Today, these customers have excellent visibility into the traffic they send through Cloudflare’s network, but sometimes they may lack visibility into traffic that isn’t sent through Cloudflare. This can include traffic that remains on a local network, or network traffic sent in between cloud environments. Magic WAN and Cloudflare One customers can add Magic Network Monitoring into their suite of product solutions to establish end-to-end network visibility across all traffic on their network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="a-deep-dive-into-network-flow-and-network-traffic-sampling"&gt;A deep dive into network flow and network traffic sampling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring gives customers better visibility into their network traffic by ingesting and analyzing network flow data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process starts when a router (or other network flow generation device) collects &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"&gt;statistical samples&lt;/a&gt; of inbound and / or outbound packet data. These samples are collected by examining 1 in every X packets, where X is the sampling rate configured on the router. Typical sampling rates range from 1 in every 1,000 to 1 in every 4,000 packets. The ideal sampling rate depends on the traffic volume, traffic diversity, and the compute / memory power of your router’s hardware. You can read more about the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/routers/recommended-sampling-rate/"&gt;recommended network flow sampling rate&lt;/a&gt; in Cloudflare’s MNM Developer Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sampled data is packaged into one of two industry standard formats for network flow data: NetFlow or sFlow. In NetFlow, the sampled packet data is grouped by different packet characteristics such as source / destination IP, port, and protocol. Each group of sampled packet data also includes a traffic volume estimate. In sFlow, the entire packet header is selected as the representative sample, and there isn’t any data summarization. As a result, sFlow is a richer data format and includes more details about network traffic than NetFlow data. Once either the NetFlow or sFlow data samples are collected, they’re sent to Magic Network Monitoring for analysis and alerting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="400" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/4-1.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="why-simple-random-sampling-didn%E2%80%99t-work-for-magic-network-monitoring"&gt;Why simple random sampling didn’t work for Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring has come a long way from its early access release one year ago. In particular, the Cloudflare engineering team invested significant time in improving the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations in MNM. In the early access version of Magic Network Monitoring, customers were unexpectedly reporting that their network traffic volume estimates were too high and didn’t match the expected value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Network Monitoring performs its own sampling of the NetFlow or sFlow data it receives, so it can effectively scale and manage the data ingested across Cloudflare’s global network. Increasing the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations was more difficult than expected, as the NetFlow or sFlow data parsed by MNM is already built on sampled packet data. This introduces multiple distinct layers of data sampling in the product’s analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first version of Magic Network Monitoring used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample"&gt;random sampling&lt;/a&gt; where a random subset of network flow data with the same timestamp was selected to represent the traffic volume at that point in time. A characteristic of network flow data is that some samples are more significant than others and represent a greater volume of network traffic. In order to account for this significance, we can associate a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; with each sample based on the traffic volume it represents. Network flow data weights are always positive numbers, and they follow a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail"&gt;long tail distribution&lt;/a&gt;. These data characteristics caused MNM’s random sampling to incorrectly estimate the traffic volume of a customer’s network. Customers would see false spikes in their traffic volume analytics when an outlying data sample from the long tail was randomly selected to be the representative of all traffic at that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="400" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/5-1.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="increasing-accuracy-with-varopt-reservoir-sampling"&gt;Increasing accuracy with VarOpt reservoir sampling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, the Cloudflare engineering team implemented an alternative &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling"&gt;reservoir sampling&lt;/a&gt; technique called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0473.pdf"&gt;VarOpt&lt;/a&gt;. VarOpt is designed to collect samples from a stream of data when the length of the data stream is unknown (a perfect application for analyzing incoming network flow data). In the MNM implementation of VarOpt, we start with an empty reservoir of a fixed size that is filled with samples of network flow data. When the reservoir is full, and there is still new incoming network flow data, an old sample is randomly discarded from the reservoir and replaced with a new one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a certain number of samples have been observed, we calculate the traffic volume across all weighted samples in the reservoir, and that is the estimated traffic volume of a customer’s network flow at that point in time. Finally, the reservoir is emptied, and the VarOpt loop is restarted by filling the reservoir with the next set of the latest network flow samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new VarOpt sampling method significantly increased the accuracy of the traffic volume estimations in Magic Network Monitoring, and solved our customer’s problems. These sampling improvements paved the way for general availability, and we’re excited to make accurate network flow analytics available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="320" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/6-1.png" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id="developer-docs-and-discord-community"&gt;Developer Docs and Discord Community&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are detailed &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;Developer Docs for Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; that explain the product’s features and outlines a step-by-step configuration guide for new customers.

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231018-00/?p=108904</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A customer had code that used the &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue.Has­Thread­Access&lt;/code&gt; property, but found that the code crashed when running on Windows Server 2019 systems,¹ because the &lt;code&gt;Has­Thread­Access&lt;/code&gt; property wasn&amp;#8217;t added until Windows Server Version 1903.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wondered if there was a way to find out whether you are running on a &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8216;s thread without using the &lt;code&gt;Has­Thread­Access&lt;/code&gt; property?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let&amp;#8217;s browse around the members of &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Member&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Available in Server 2019?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GetForCurrentThread&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CreateTimer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TryEnqueue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ShutdownStaring&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ShutdownCompleted&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HasThreadAccess&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that you can see if a particular &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt; belongs to the current thread by simply reversing the question: Ask the current thread for its &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt; and see if it&amp;#8217;s the one you were given. This relies on the fact that each thread can have at most one &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher­Queue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;// Alternate version that simulates HasThreadAccess
// on Windows Server 2019.

// C++/WinRT
bool DispatcherQueueHasThreadAccess(DispatcherQueue const&amp;amp; q)
{
    ASSERT(q != nullptr); // caller should have checked this first
    return q == DispatcherQueue::GetForCurrentThread();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer reported back that it worked great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of computer programming is just looking at the tools you have available in your toolbox and seeing whether you can combine them in an interesting way to accomplish your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¹ Still in extended support until 2029!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Python's F-String for String Interpolation and Formatting</title>
      <link>https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python &lt;strong&gt;f-strings&lt;/strong&gt; provide a quick way to &lt;strong&gt;interpolate&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;format&lt;/strong&gt; strings. They’re readable, concise, and less prone to error than traditional string interpolation and formatting tools, such as the &lt;code&gt;.format()&lt;/code&gt; method and the modulo operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;). An f-string is also a bit faster than those tools!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know why f-strings are such a powerful tool that you should learn and master as a Python developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpolate&lt;/strong&gt; values, objects, and expressions into your strings using &lt;strong&gt;f-strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Format&lt;/strong&gt; f-strings using Python’s &lt;strong&gt;string formatting mini-language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage some &lt;strong&gt;cool features&lt;/strong&gt; of f-strings in Python 3.12 and beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide when to use &lt;strong&gt;traditional interpolation&lt;/strong&gt; tools instead of &lt;strong&gt;f-strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with Python’s &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-strings/"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; data type. It’s also be beneficial to have experience with other string interpolation tools like the modulo operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) and the &lt;code&gt;.format()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-warning"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Your Code:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="alert-link" href="https://realpython.com/bonus/python-f-string-code/"&gt;Click here to download the free sample code&lt;/a&gt; that shows you how to do string interpolation and formatting with Python’s f-strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="interpolating-and-formatting-strings-before-python-36"&gt;Interpolating and Formatting Strings Before Python 3.6&lt;a class="headerlink" href="https://realpython.com/atom.xml#interpolating-and-formatting-strings-before-python-36" title="Permanent link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Python 3.6, you had two main tools for interpolating values, variables, and expressions inside string literals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting"&gt;string interpolation operator&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;), or modulo operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format"&gt;&lt;code&gt;str.format()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll get a refresher on these two string interpolation tools in the following sections. You’ll also learn about the string formatting capabilities that these tools offer in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-modulo-operator"&gt;The Modulo Operator, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a class="headerlink" href="https://realpython.com/atom.xml#the-modulo-operator" title="Permanent link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modulo operator (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) was the first tool for string interpolation and formatting in Python and has been in the language since the beginning. Here’s what using this operator looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jane"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;!"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;'Hello, Jane!'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this quick example, you use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator to interpolate the value of your &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; variable into a string literal. The interpolation operator takes two operands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A string literal containing one or more conversion specifiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The object or objects that you’re interpolating into the string literal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;conversion specifiers&lt;/strong&gt; work as replacement fields. In the above example, you use the &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; combination of characters as a conversion specifier. The &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; symbol marks the start of the specifier, while the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; letter is the &lt;strong&gt;conversion type&lt;/strong&gt; and tells the operator that you want to convert the input object into a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to insert more than one object into your target string, then you can use a &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-tuple/"&gt;tuple&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the number of objects in the tuple must match the number of format specifiers in the string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jane"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;! You're &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; years old."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;'Hello, Jane! You're 25 years old.'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, you use a tuple of values as the right-hand operand to &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. Note that you’ve used a string and an integer. Because you use the &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; specifier, Python converts both objects to strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use dictionaries as the right-hand operand in your interpolation expressions. To do this, you need to create conversion specifiers that enclose key names in parentheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(name)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;! You're &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%(age)s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; years old."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jane"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;"Hello, Jane! You're 25 years old."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This syntax provides a readable approach to string interpolation with the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator. You can use descriptive key names instead of relying on the positional order of values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator for string interpolation, you can use conversion specifiers. They provide some string formatting capabilities that take advantage of &lt;strong&gt;conversion types&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;conversion flags&lt;/strong&gt;, and some characters like the period (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) and the asterisk (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;). Consider the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight python repl"&gt;&lt;span class="repl-toggle" title="Toggle REPL prompts and output"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Balance: $&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%.2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;5425.9292&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;'Balance: $5425.93'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Age: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"John"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Name: John&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Age:    35&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first example, you use the &lt;code&gt;%.2f&lt;/code&gt; conversion specifier to represent currency values. The &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; letter tells the operator to convert to a floating-point number. The &lt;code&gt;.2&lt;/code&gt; part defines the precision to use when converting the input. In the second example, you use &lt;code&gt;%5s&lt;/code&gt; to align the age value five positions to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Safe URLs 101: Spotting the Red Flags</title>
      <link>https://catonmat.net/safe-urls-101</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TLDR: You can use &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; (that I and my team built) to check if a URL is safe or not. We run browsers in the cloud in virtual machines and you get a remote connection to a browser. This way, you can open any bad URLs without the risk of infecting your device as everything runs in this this remote browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world has become digitally interconnected, the importance of being able to discern between safe and unsafe URLs has never been more relevant. Unsafe URLs can lead to malware infections, phishing attempts, and breaches of personal data. In this article, I'll tell you everything I know (I have 20 years of experience in web security) about how to distinguish between safe and unsafe URLs and how to use &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; to spot and avoid these digital landmines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the URL structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before delving into the signs of an unsafe URL, it's crucial to know the basic parts of a URL. A URL can be broken into seven parts: protocol scheme, subdomain, domain, top level domain (TLD), path, query string, and anchor. Let's look at each part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protocol Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the initial part of a web address that determines the communication protocol or a program that will be used to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;mailto&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;, which is secure version of the HTTP protocol used for online communication, ensuring data is encrypted and transmitted safely between a user's device and a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Domain Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main part of a web address. It's a human-readable address that uniquely identifies a website or online resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yahoo.com&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;digg.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subdomain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the optional part before a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;shop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;, which is a commonly used prefix in web addresses, denoting &amp;quot;World Wide Web&amp;quot;, and it serves as a standard subdomain for almost all websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Top-Level Domain (TLD)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending segment of a web address, indicating the domain's type, category or country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.it&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A specific page on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/account&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;/resources/free/downloads&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/blog&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt;, which leads users to the blog section or another page of a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Query String&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part starts with a question mark &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and allows sending parameters to a page, and it's often in the format of &lt;code&gt;key=value&lt;/code&gt; pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;?id=123&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?search=python&amp;amp;sort=date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=puppies&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;?q=puppies&lt;/code&gt;, which loads the search query for puppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anchor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anchor is used to direct you to a specific section of a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;#footer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;#tools&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/blog#top-posts&lt;/code&gt;, it's &lt;code&gt;#top-posts&lt;/code&gt;, which scrolls the webpage to the top posts section of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Full URL Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;https://www.google.com/blog/post?id=123#tools&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheme: &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subdomain: &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain Name: &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-Level Domain (TLD): &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path: &lt;code&gt;/blog/post&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query String: &lt;code&gt;?id=123&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor: &lt;code&gt;#tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spotting Unsafe URLs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 15 signs that can help you identify and avoid unsafe URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Mismatched URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hover over a link to see where it leads to. If the hover link doesn't match the URL or the title in the text, be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a ligature used in place of a letter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says &lt;code&gt;Bank of America&lt;/code&gt; but hover is &lt;code&gt;bankofarnerica.com&lt;/code&gt; (the letters &amp;quot;rn&amp;quot; are combined together to create a ligature that looks like letter &amp;quot;m&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a number used as a letter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says &lt;code&gt;PayPal&lt;/code&gt; but it hovers as &lt;code&gt;paypa1.com&lt;/code&gt; (digit &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; is used in place of the letter el - &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Misspelled Domains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typos or slight variations of popular domain names can lead to malicious websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of misspelled Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You search for a book and click on a link that seems to lead to &lt;code&gt;amazon.com&lt;/code&gt;, but a closer look reveals it says &lt;code&gt;amazom.com&lt;/code&gt; (last letter is &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of misspelled Facebook&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You try logging into &lt;code&gt;facebook.com&lt;/code&gt; but find yourself at &lt;code&gt;facebokk.com&lt;/code&gt; instead (instead of &amp;quot;book&amp;quot;, it says &amp;quot;bokk&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Unicode characters in URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs that contain fake Unicode characters pose a great danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a homoglyph attack&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching for a Samsung phone update, you find a link to &lt;code&gt;ѕаmѕung.соm&lt;/code&gt;. It turns out this address is fake as it replaces standard characters with visually similar Unicode characters (called homoglyphs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a Punycode deception&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're searching for a security product and visit &lt;code&gt;security.com&lt;/code&gt; but after visiting, your browser shows &lt;code&gt;xn--scurity-w4a.com&lt;/code&gt; in the address bar. The real address was &lt;code&gt;sécurity.com&lt;/code&gt; and the browser converted it to an international domain name (IDN) encoding called Punycode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Unusual Top-Level Domain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncommon TLDs that don't align with the site's supposed purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a government website at a .kim domain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for a government service, you stumble upon &lt;code&gt;GovernmentAgency.kim&lt;/code&gt;, which doesn't feel official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a clothing brand's website at a .horse domain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for an Italian clothing brand's site but land on &lt;code&gt;ItalianBrand.horse&lt;/code&gt;, which seems inconsistent with their product line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Excessive Redirects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs that send you through multiple sites rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake online deal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're hoping to snag an online deal at &lt;code&gt;greatoffer90.com&lt;/code&gt;, but you find yourself being bounced between multiple unrelated websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake movie website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trying to watch a movie on &lt;code&gt;freemoviesnow.com&lt;/code&gt; but the page keeps shifting and redirecting, never settling on the content you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. URL Shorteners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services that conceal the end destination of a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a bit.ly link&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend sends you a &lt;code&gt;bit.ly&lt;/code&gt; link (such as &lt;code&gt;bit.ly/XXXXX&lt;/code&gt; and you can't determine its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a tinyurl.com link&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email offers a great discount, but the link is a shortened &lt;code&gt;tinyurl.com/XXXXX&lt;/code&gt;, hiding its true endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Generic Greetings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emails or messages that come with vague salutations instead of personalized greetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an impersonal account update email&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email asks you to update your account details &lt;code&gt;for security reasons&lt;/code&gt; with a link reading &lt;code&gt;accountupdate.com&lt;/code&gt; and an impersonal greeting of &lt;code&gt;Dear valued member&lt;/code&gt; (instead of your name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a lucky visitor popup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notification pops up, claiming you're a lucky visitor and you've won a prize and urging you to visit &lt;code&gt;surprisewin.com&lt;/code&gt; with the salutation &lt;code&gt;Hello user&lt;/code&gt; (instead of your name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Unsolicited Invitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected URLs from known and unknown senders can be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an invitation to an unknown photo site&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from an unknown sender urging you to see an amazing photo at &lt;code&gt;checkoutthisphoto.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an invitation to view a PDF file&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive a message saying a colleague has shared a PDF document on &lt;code&gt;seemyresume.net&lt;/code&gt;, but you weren't expecting any such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. Too-Good-To-Be-True Offers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promising deals or prizes that seem too generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a link to huge winnings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ad claims you can win a million dollars instantly, directing you to &lt;code&gt;win-1million-now.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unexpected prize&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive an email promising a free top-end smartphone for every form that you fill at &lt;code&gt;freesmartphones.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Alarmist Messages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites that induce panic to make you act quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a popup asking you to act quickly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pop-up warns of suspicious activity on your account and insists you visit &lt;code&gt;urgent-account-alert.com&lt;/code&gt; to resolve it or else your account will be suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an alert telling your PC has been infected with a virus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alert pops up saying your PC has been infected with a virus and asks you to fix your PC by visiting &lt;code&gt;instant-pcfixer.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. Grammar and Spelling Errors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes in the URL and link text can indicate deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a login page with a typo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trying to access a login page and you find the link reads &lt;code&gt;officiall-login.com&lt;/code&gt;, with a duplicate letter &amp;quot;el&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a grammar and spelling error in text surrounding the link&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive an email from an online payment service but it says &lt;code&gt;Varifay, your acount to login&lt;/code&gt;, with terrible grammar and spelling errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. Inconsistent Branding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website's design or URL structure doesn't match the known branding of a reputed entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a broken logo on Google's login page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You click on a Google login page, but something feels off. The page URL &lt;code&gt;google-securelogin.com&lt;/code&gt; and the logo is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake Apple support page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Apple support, the site you land on has a web address &lt;code&gt;applesupports.org&lt;/code&gt;, which is nicely made, but doesn't align with Apple's official domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;13. No Contact Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absence of genuine contact details on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a fake product support site&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an issue with a product, you try reaching out via &lt;code&gt;contactsupportnow.com&lt;/code&gt;, but the site has just one page and lacks any genuine contact details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a page with no contact details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needing customer care, &lt;code&gt;customercareinfo.net&lt;/code&gt; appears to offer support but has no phone number or physical address listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;14. Unexpected Software Downloads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URLs that initiate unsolicited software or file downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unexpected download&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to listen to some new music tracks, you click on &lt;code&gt;freemusicdownloader.com&lt;/code&gt;, only for it to start downloading an unexpected executable file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of a download without your consent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend suggests a cool new app, but &lt;code&gt;getthisappnow.com&lt;/code&gt; initiates an unsolicited software download without your consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;15. Lack of HTTPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A missing secure protocol can indicate the site isn't encrypted, which can lead to personal data and credit card exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unsafe banking website&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A banking website that doesn't use https: &lt;code&gt;http://yourbanklogin.com&lt;/code&gt;. Here instead of &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; it uses &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example of an unsafe payment portal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secure payments portal that doesn't use HTTPS: &lt;code&gt;http://secure-paymentportal.com&lt;/code&gt;. Here, again, it uses unsecure &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol instead of secure &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Browserling Can Help You Spot Unsafe URLs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I dove deep into 15 key signs that can help you identify potentially malicious URLs, it's essential to understand that the digital landscape of unsafe URLs is vast and ever-evolving. In many respects, I've just skimmed the surface of the complex world of cybersecurity threats related to URLs. Fortunately, my service &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; stands as a bulwark against these diverse threats and offers a secure layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Browserling?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browserling is a web-based service that offers real-time remote access to sandboxed browsers that allow users to run browsers from different operating systems directly in their own browser. As the browsers are sandboxed, the browsing sessions are isolated, making it especially useful for testing potentially unsafe URLs without risking one's own system or data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interactive Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browserling isn't just a passive tool. It offers a live and interactive browsing experience that can help security professionals recognize unusual site behaviors, from unexpected redirects to aggressive pop-ups, and other potential red flags not covered in the initial 15 signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cross-Browser Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals sometimes exploit browser-specific and platform-specific vulnerabilities. For example, they might target Chrome version 115 that runs on Windows 10. Browserling's capability to test URLs across multiple browsers and platforms means you're not just looking for general threats, but also those that are browser-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zero Additional Risks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no required downloads, installs, or extensions, Browserling ensures that your safety isn't compromised by adding potential vulnerabilities. Every interaction is web-based, keeping a safe distance from potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clean State Every Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each session with Browserling is temporary and wiped clean after use. This clean up of session data guarantees that no malware, viruses, cookies, or trackers linger post-investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Secure Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browserling prioritizes user data privacy and security with SSL-encrypted connections. This ensures that, while you're investigating a URL, your connection remains invisible to potential eavesdroppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of unsafe URLs extends far beyond the 15 signs I initially outlined. With Browserling, users are equipped with an advanced tool offering both breadth and depth in analysis and defense against the countless URL-based cyber threats. &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com/browse"&gt;Give it a try&lt;/a&gt; and browse safe!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PKI hosting: Cloud-based PKI vs. self managed</title>
      <link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/pki-hosting-cloud-based-pki-vs-self-managed</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaaS solutions for public key infrastructure (PKI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cloud-based PKI vs on-premises PKI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advantages of cloud-based PKI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HashiCorp Vault for PKI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;self-managed PKI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKI的介绍，包括常见的应用场景和核心流程&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;云端PKI和HCP Vault，包括服务模型和优势&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在HCP Vault上运行PKI的好处，如降低操作负担、增加安全性、控制成本、提高可靠性和易用性&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自管理PKI的好处，如控制、灵活性、自主性、安全性和合规性&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HashiCorp为PKI提供的解决方案&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文探讨了在云端和自管理环境中托管PKI环境的因素和考虑事项。云端PKI在降低操作负担、提高安全性、控制成本、可靠性和易用性方面具有优势。然而，自管理PKI在满足特定的合规性和监管要求方面更加灵活。HashiCorp的HCP Vault和Vault Enterprise提供了满足不同需求的PKI解决方案。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many organizations are leveraging SaaS solutions for public key infrastructure (PKI) to protect their workloads in the cloud. However, PKI running in self-managed environments also remains a popular choice, and is a requirement for some highly regulated industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are important factors organizations need to consider before deciding which option is the best choice for their requirements, but the advantages of cloud-based PKI versus an on-premises approach are not always well understood. This blog explores the factors organizations should consider when deciding how to host their PKI environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PKI explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PKI is the standard process for provisioning and maintaining digital certificates for authentication and encryption of digital identities associated with users, devices, and applications. Common PKI use cases include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL and TLS certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Device and endpoint certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code signing certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital signatures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing access to APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate-based VPNs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a simplified illustration of the core PKI process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="PKI" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1697504081-pki-process.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public key cryptography is the foundation of PKI. It is a strong encryption mechanism that relies on public and private key pairs. The keys are used together to encrypt and decrypt messages based on cryptographic algorithms, helping to protect identities and data from unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cloud PKI and HCP Vault&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of this post, cloud PKI refers to a service or hosting model in the cloud where a service provider hosts and manages the infrastructure and the customer is responsible for the certificate authority (CA), as well as the PKI environment for provisioning and managing certificates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With self-managed PKI, workloads may be hosted in a cloud environment or a more traditional on-premises datacenter. With a self-managed approach, the organization is responsible for maintaining the PKI infrastructure and operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A look into the delivery models for &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault"&gt;HashiCorp Vault&lt;/a&gt; can help make it clear what options are available and which one might be best for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HashiCorp’s cloud PKI functionality resides in &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault"&gt;HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault&lt;/a&gt;. HCP Vault is a fully managed implementation of Vault operated by HashiCorp, allowing organizations to get up and running quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an organization chooses to allow a public connection, the HCP Vault cluster will have an associated public address where clients can directly connect to Vault. (Most organizations disable the public connection for security reasons.) The organization can then establish a peering connection between its cloud provider and a HashiCorp virtual network (HVN). This ensures that only trusted clients (users, applications, containers, etc.) running in the peered public cloud provider can connect to Vault and stops systems outside of the selected network from attempting to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="PKI" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1697504191-pki-infrastructure.png" /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of PKI on HCP Vault&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running PKI on HCP enables users to secure, store, and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys within one unified cloud-based platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key benefits of running cloud PKI on HCP Vault include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced operational overhead:&lt;/strong&gt; Push-button deployment as well as fully managed upgrades and backups mean organizations can focus on adoption and integration instead of operational overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased security across clouds and machines:&lt;/strong&gt; HCP Vault allows organizations to secure their globally diverse infrastructure and applications through a single management interface, to restrict access to sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced operating costs due to HashiCorp's engineers running and maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; HashiCorp has experience supporting thousands of commercial Vault clusters and HCP Vault brings that expertise directly to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of use:&lt;/strong&gt; HCP Vault is built around making onboarding its cloud security automation simple. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of self-managed PKI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A managed product like HCP Vault brings many benefits, but organizations should also consider their particular needs when choosing how and where to host their PKI environment. Frequently, those needs are driven by compliance and regulatory requirements associated with specific industries, where self-managed hosting may be appropriate. Self-managed Vault comes in two editions: A free community edition for small use cases, and Vault Enterprise for larger organizations or organizations with stricter security requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of a running a self-managed PKI environment with Vault include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control:&lt;/strong&gt; The certificate provisioning, revocation, and rotation process is within your control, and you are not limited when accessing the cloud. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; On-premises management can be more flexible in terms of customization based on the requirements and capacity of the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-reliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Since critical data is kept in-house, configuration changes can be done on-premises and on your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security and compliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud service providers don’t always support the compliance and standards required for particular industries. Self-managed environments allow organizations to customize their environments for their specific compliance needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;HashiCorp and PKI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, both cloud-based and self-managed PKI solutions have their pros and cons. That’s why HashiCorp offers multiple ways to address your PKI needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud PKI offers agility, ease of use, and reduced operational overhead, whereas self-managed PKI offers more options to customize and meet specific security and compliance requirements. HashiCorp can meet your organization’s needs for not only both types of PKI, but both cloud-based or self-managed certificate lifecycle management platforms (CLM), which is a broader effort to secure identity information and implement data protection to secure your users, devices, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Startups and SMBs finding success with DigitalOcean Managed Kafka</title>
      <link>https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/digitalocean-managed-kafka-ga-launch</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt; DigitalOcean Managed Kafka，SMBs，simplified management，affordable pricing，scaling up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大纲：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean发布了Managed Kafka，为初创企业和中小型企业提供了Apache Kafka的强大功能，以便在DigitalOcean的经济实惠且易于管理的套餐中使用。自管理Kafka复杂，耗时费力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean Managed Kafka的价格便宜且透明，适用于各种规模的企业，有助于解决SMBs使用Kafka的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed Kafka提供了简化且易于管理的体验，为客户节省时间和资源，并加快了投入生产的速度。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;数家企业通过Managed Kafka取得成功，展示了该服务的优势和效果。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;通过DigitalOcean建立一个账户，可以立即开始体验Managed Kafka。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;总结：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean推出的Managed Kafka为初创企业和中小型企业提供了简化且经济实惠的Apache Kafka解决方案。该服务的优势在于简化了复杂的管理任务，降低了成本，并且通过扩展性满足了企业的不同需求。通过Managed Kafka，客户可以专注于产品开发，节省时间和资源。此外，DigitalOcean的价格策略也使得Kafka对各种规模的企业都变得可行。如果您希望开始使用Managed Kafka，只需在DigitalOcean上注册一个账户即可立即启动。&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-digitalocean-managed-kafka"&gt;DigitalOcean released Managed Kafka&lt;/a&gt;, which provides startups and small-to-midsize businesses with the power of Apache Kafka, in an affordable, easy-to-manage package from DigitalOcean. Kafka is a powerful open-source event streaming platform, but self-managing it can be complex and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-kafka"&gt;DigitalOcean Managed Kafka&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available in &lt;a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/platform/product-lifecycle/#:~:text=General%20Availability%20offerings%20are%20fully,access%20to%20General%20Availability%20offerings."&gt;General Availability (GA)&lt;/a&gt;, many customers have found value in the simplicity and affordability of DigitalOcean Managed Kafka. Read on to hear how DigitalOcean customers are leveraging the power of Managed Kafka to grow their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kafka-without-the-complexity"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/rss#kafka-without-the-complexity"&gt;Kafka without the complexity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="hash-anchor" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/rss#kafka-without-the-complexity"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up, maintaining, and monitoring Kafka daily through self-managing &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-digitalocean-managed-kafka#remove-the-challenges-of-self-managed-kafka"&gt;has many challenges&lt;/a&gt;. However, Managed Kafka provides an experience that has made these daunting tasks much easier for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://datacake.co/"&gt;Datacake&lt;/a&gt;, a low-code IoT platform, can better focus on product development, saying that “DigitalOcean’s Managed Kafka offering has been a game-changer for us at Datacake. By taking care of the operational aspects of running our Kafka cluster, we have been able to focus our attention on what really matters - building a great product.” - Lukas Klein, Chief Technical Officer, Datacake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kairostech.io/"&gt;Kairos Sports Tech&lt;/a&gt;, which provides operation and communications for major sports teams, has implemented Managed Kafka for usage in production workloads and has many important customers of their own who rely on their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“… we were self-managing Kafka, and found the day-to-day management of running a multi-node system was time-consuming and full of complexities.” said Daniel Hendrie who is the Chief Technical Officer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the simplicity of Managed Kafka in the handling of complicated tasks, Kairos Sports Tech was able to save time and resources. Also, the ease of use led them to get to production much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“DigitalOcean Managed Kafka simplified and sped up our management of Kafka—self-managing Kafka, it would take about eight weeks to go from initial development to a production-ready system. With DigitalOcean Managed Kafka, we cut that timeline to just one week.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean Managed Kafka continues to provide simplicity at its core. To get a better overview of the simplicity offered, please check out this video on how to get started to see the simplicity for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="affordable-transparent-pricing-means-businesses-of-all-sizes-can-use-kafka"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/rss#affordable-transparent-pricing-means-businesses-of-all-sizes-can-use-kafka"&gt;Affordable, transparent pricing means businesses of all sizes can use Kafka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="hash-anchor" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/rss#affordable-transparent-pricing-means-businesses-of-all-sizes-can-use-kafka"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many managed Kafka services from other providers are extremely expensive and therefore are not viable options for SMBs, who then are forced to use self-managed Kafka, which is costly in the time it takes to administer. However, DigitalOcean Managed Kafka’s &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/managed-databases#kafka"&gt;starting price of $147&lt;/a&gt; is perfect for helping SMBs get started using Managed Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, other providers have complicated pricing schemes for Managed Kafka, with separate costs for each broker, added storage, and additional add-on features. With DigitialOcean Managed Kafka, prices are predictable with a single, flat rate price that is shown to you when creating a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="kafka-total-monthly-cost" src="https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/Kafka/total-monthly-cost.png" width="80%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key factor for any customer is to pay for what you need and avoid underutilization when going from development to production with Kafka, which can take a couple of months. With other providers, customers might have to pay a higher price for a production-grade cluster when usage is low or be locked in a short-term trial period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean pricing provides cost-effective pricing for both testing and production so anyone can get started with Managed Kafka for testing purposes. When it’s time to go live to production, customers can easily scale up their existing cluster to any of our dedicated vCPU plans, as seen below, and just pay for the additional usage when ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="kafka-production-plans" src="https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/Kafka/production-plans.png" width="80%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once you have the data you can undertake analysis, and finally, reach &lt;a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/2015/05/asktheexperts-10-ways-social-media-will-boost-your-business-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;social business intelligence&lt;/a&gt;; using all these insights to know your customers better and improve your marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you are a social media rookie, this list of the top free social media monitoring tools might come in handy. When looking for a tool, it&amp;#8217;s a good idea to try a couple of them and choose the one that suits your needs best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;However, bear in mind that these tools are not an alternative to Enterprise-level tools, such as &lt;a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Brandwatch&lt;/a&gt;, which brought social media monitoring to a new level, offering a much higher variety of services, functionality, and in-depth analysis. It all depends on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;1) &lt;a href="https://hootsuite.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Hootsuite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hootsuite is one of the best free social media listening tools available and covers multiple social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WordPress, Foursquare and Google+. It is well known for its social media management functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The weekly reports and the excellent team management facility (delegating tasks, sending private messages) can be very useful when there’s more than one person handling the social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hootsuite Social Media Listening Tool" class="aligncenter wp-image-61602 size-full" height="340" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hootsuite-social-listening-tool.png" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://tweetreach.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;TweetReach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TweetReach is a great monitoring tool for your business if you’re interested in checking how far your Tweets travel. TweetReach measures the actual impact and implications of social media discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is a good way of finding out who are your most influential followers, implicitly guiding you towards the right people you should be targeting when aiming to share and promote online content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TweetReach is social media listening for twitter" class="aligncenter wp-image-61717 size-full" height="577" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tweet-reach.png" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;3) &lt;a href="http://klout.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Klout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klout is probably one of the most controversial social media monitoring tools. There are &lt;a href="http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2013/06/opt-out-of-klout-now/"&gt;those who hate it&lt;/a&gt; and claim that its scoring system is completely inaccurate and that trying to interact with them is an impossible mission (a curious thing as they provide interaction-measurement services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On the other hand, some people &lt;a href="http://onlinebizinformation.com/a-klout-review-track-my-influence/"&gt;find it useful&lt;/a&gt;, as it measures influence through engagement on Twitter. It is a good means of keeping an eye on what people think about your brand, and to see what influences them the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Using the Klout score you can adjust your posts according to your target audience’s interests and increase your engagement rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="klout - social monitoring that assigns a score to each user" class="aligncenter wp-image-61718 size-full" height="464" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/klout.png" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;4)&lt;a href="http://buzzsumo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt; Buzzsumo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Buzzsumo is a great tool for content research, but it also has an excellent way to analyze and monitor your Facebook pages. Along with metrics around each individual post, more interestingly is the ability to see what content performs best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Buzzsumo will tell you what day is the best to post, how long your posts should be, what types of content works best, and monthly stats over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-116355 size-full" height="656" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image.png" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;5)&lt;a href="http://www.twazzup.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt; Twazzup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twazzup is great for social media beginners looking for a Twitter monitoring tool. You just enter the name you want to track and you instantly get real-time updates, meaning the most active top influencers, most retweeted photos and links, and most importantly, the top 10 keywords related to your search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="twazzup helps you listen to online media" class="aligncenter wp-image-61721 size-full" height="388" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/twazzup2.png" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;6) &lt;a href="http://boardreader.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Boardreader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we forget that social media doesn&amp;#8217;t just include the big players. Forums and messaging boards count too. Boardreader allows you to search for specific terms on a range of different forums to see what people are saying about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting in a term will returns a list of all of these posts up to the previous two years, you can generate charts to look for trends, and compare terms against each other. It&amp;#8217;s a great way to find conversations about your brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A brand mention monitoring chart from Boardreader" class="alignnone wp-image-108559 size-large" height="568" src="https://s14415.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2017-10-30-at-14.42.51-1024x619.png" width="940" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HowSociable is a handy tool for measuring your and your competitors&amp;#8217; social media presence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is a Virtual Browser?</title>
      <link>https://catonmat.net/what-is-a-virtual-browser</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, extracted from my &lt;a href="https://catonmat.net/virtual-browser-comprehensive-guide"&gt;Comprehensive Virtual Browser Guide&lt;/a&gt;, I explain what a virtual browser is and how to quickly get access to one via Browserling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Virtual Browser Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A demo speaks louder than a thousand words. You can open a virtual browser created by me and my team via &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com/browse"&gt;browserling.com/browse&lt;/a&gt;. We run virtual browsers on our servers and stream just the browser window to you. No cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Virtual Browser – What Is It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual browser is a regular browser that's been modified to run in a sandboxed environment that executes it on a remote server rather than on your local device. This architecture enables cross-browser testing, secure browsing, and access to web content without exposing your local system and network to potential web-based vulnerabilities. By rendering web pages server-side and streaming just the browser window to you, virtual browsers can mitigate risks associated with direct Internet access. Additionally, virtual browsers offer an easy way for web developers to perform compatibility checks and debugging by providing access to multiple browser versions (such as Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) and operating systems (such as Windows, MacOS, and Android) from a single interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about virtual browsers in my &lt;a href="https://catonmat.net/virtual-browser-comprehensive-guide"&gt;Comprehensive Virtual Browser Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Virtual Browser via Browserling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can instantly get a virtual browser via Browserling. &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; is a web-based service that offers virtual browsers to users, allowing them to run browsers in a secure, sandboxed environment on Browserling's servers. This service enables users to test websites across different browsers and versions without the need to install them locally. By providing access to these virtual browsers, Browserling helps in ensuring compatibility and performance of web applications across various browser setups, enhancing web development and testing processes. Beyond web development, Browserling's virtual browsers are also valuable for secure browsing, as they isolate the user's local system from potential web-based threats, and for automated web tasks, where scripts and interactions can be executed safely in a sandboxed environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy browsing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Ruby devroom is back at FOSDEM</title>
      <link>https://thoughtbot.com/blog/ruby-devroom-fosdem2024</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yours truly has written an application for a Ruby devroom at &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/"&gt;FOSDEM2024&lt;/a&gt; and the organizers were gracious enough to give it!
It has been 6 long years since Ruby got a room at FOSDEM, so it&amp;rsquo;s a merry thing for our community to have it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invite you all, beginners as well as veterans, to give a talk. 
&lt;a href="https://fosdem.rubybelgium.be/"&gt;This is the ruby call for participation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM will be held the weekend of the 3rd and 4th of February in Brussels, Belgium. The Ruby devroom will be open the Saturday afternoon. Having gone to FOSDEM a few times now, I can honestly say that it offers a lot throughout the weekend, even without a Ruby devroom. It&amp;rsquo;s better with one, needless to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you&amp;rsquo;re one of our blog readers, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t submit a proposal, please come and say hi!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to write a special mention to my co-organizer &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boyet/"&gt;Stan Boyet&lt;/a&gt;. He leads &lt;a href="https://rubybelgium.be/"&gt;RubyBelgium&lt;/a&gt; with panache and is helping with this new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Road localisation in GrabMaps</title>
      <link>https://engineering.grab.com/road-localisation-grabmaps</link>
      <description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Grab achieved self-sufficiency in its Geo services. As part of this transition, one crucial step was moving towards using an internally-developed map tailored specifically to the market in which Grab operates. Now that we have full control over the map layer, we can add more data to it or improve it according to the needs of the services running on top. One key aspect that this transition unlocked for us was the possibility of creating hyperlocal data at map level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, by determining the country to which a road belongs, we can now automatically infer the official language of that country and display the street name in that language. In another example, knowing the country for a specific road, we can automatically infer the driving side (left-handed or right-handed) leading to an improved navigation experience. Furthermore, this capability also enables us to efficiently handle various scenarios. For example, if we know that a road is part of a gated community, an area where our driver partners face restricted access, we can prevent the transit through that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples of the possibilities from having full control over the map layer. By having an internal map, we can align our maps with specific markets and provide better experiences for our driver-partners and customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these to be possible, we first needed to localise the roads inside the map. Our goal was to include hyperlocal data into the map, which refers to data that is specific to a certain area, such as a country, city, or even a smaller part of the city like a gated community. At the same time, we aimed to deliver our map with a high cadence, thus, we needed to find the right way to process this large amount of data while continuing to create maps in a cost-effective manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections of this article, we will use an extract from the Southeast Asia map to provide visual representations of the concepts discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Figure 1, Image 1 shows a visualisation of the road network, the roads belonging to this area. The coloured lines in Image 2 represent the borders identifying the countries in the same area. Overlapping the information from Image 1 and Image 2, we can extrapolate and say that the entire surface included in a certain border could have the same set of common properties as shown in Image 3. In Image 4, we then proceed with adding localised roads for each area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/localisation.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 1 - Map of Southeast Asia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this to be possible, we have to find a way to localise each road and identify its associated country. Once this localisation process is complete, we can replicate all this information specific to a given border onto each individual road. This information includes details such as the country name, driving side, and official language. We can go even further and infer more information, and add hyperlocal data. For example, in Vietnam, we can automatically prevent motorcycle access on the motorways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assigning each road on the map to a specific area, such as a country, service area, or subdivision, presents a complex task. So, how can we efficiently accomplish this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="implementation"&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward approach would be to test the inclusion of each road into each area boundary, but that is easier said than done. With close to 30 million road segments in the Southeast Asia map and over 10 thousand areas, the computational cost of determining inclusion or intersection between a polyline and a polygon is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution to this challenge involves replacing the expensive yet precise operation with a decent approximation. We introduce a proxy entity, the geohash, and we use it to approximate the areas and also to localise the roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We replace the geometrical inclusion with a series of simpler and less expensive operations. First, we conduct an inexpensive precomputation where we identify all the geohases that belong to a certain area or within a defined border. We then identify the geohashes to which the roads  belong to. Finally, we use these precomputed values to assign roads to their respective areas. This process is also computationally inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the large area we process, we leverage big data techniques to distribute the execution across multiple nodes and thus speed up the operation. We want to deliver the map daily and this is one of the many operations that are part of the map-making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-geohash"&gt;What is a geohash?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further understand our implementation we will first explain the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash"&gt;geohash concept&lt;/a&gt;. A geohash is a unique identifier of a specific region on the Earth. The basic idea is that the Earth is divided into regions of user-defined size and each region is assigned a unique id, which is known as its geohash. For a given location on earth, the geohash algorithm converts its latitude and longitude into a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geohashes uses a Base-32 alphabet encoding system comprising characters ranging from  0 to 9 and A to Z, excluding “A”, “I”, “L” and “O”. Imagine dividing the world into a grid with 32 cells. The first character in a geohash identifies the initial location of one of these 32 cells. Each of these cells are then further subdivided into 32 smaller cells.This subdivision process continues and refines to specific areas in the world. Adding characters to the geohash sub-divides a cell, effectively zooming in to a more detailed area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precision factor of the geohash determines the size of the cell. For instance, a precision factor of one creates a cell 5,000 km high and 5,000 km wide. A precision factor of six creates a cell 0.61km high and 1.22 km wide. Furthermore, a precision factor of nine creates a cell 4.77 m high and 4.77 m wide. It is important to note that cells are not always square and can have varying dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Figure 2,  we have exemplified a geohash 6 grid and its code is &lt;strong&gt;wsdt33&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/geohash-code-wsdt33.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 2 - An example of geohash code wsdt33&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="using-less-expensive-operations"&gt;Using less expensive operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculating the inclusion of the roads inside a certain border is an expensive operation. However, quantifying the exact expense is challenging as it depends on several factors. One factor is the complexity of the border. Borders are usually irregular and very detailed, as they need to correctly reflect the actual border. The complexity of the road geometry is another factor that plays an important role as roads are not always straight lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/roads-to-localise.png" style="width: 30%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 3 - Roads to localise&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this operation is expensive both in terms of cloud cost and time to run, we need to identify a cheaper and faster way that would yield similar results. Knowing that the complexity of the border lines is the cause of the problem, we tried using a different alternative, a rectangle. Calculating the inclusion of a polyline inside a rectangle is a cheaper operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/roads-inside-rectangle.png" style="width: 20%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 4 - Roads inside a rectangle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we transformed this large, one step operation, where we test each road segment for inclusion in a border, into a series of smaller operations where we perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify all the geohashes that are part of a certain area or belong to a certain border. In this process we include additional areas to make sure that we cover the entire surface inside the border.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each road segment, we identify the list of geohashes that it belongs to. A road, depending on its length or depending on its shape, might belong to multiple geohashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Figure 5, we identify that the road belongs to two geohashes and that the two geohashes are part of the border we use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/geohash-proxy.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 5 - Geohashes as proxy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all we need to do is join the two data sets together. This kind of operation is a great candidate for a big data approach, as it allows us to run it in parallel and speed up the processing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="precision-tradeoff"&gt;Precision tradeoff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mentioned earlier that, for the sake of argument, we replace precision with a decent approximation. Let’s now delve into the real tradeoff by adopting this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that stands out with this approach is that we traded precision for cost. We are able to reduce the cost as this approach uses less hardware resources and computation time. However, this reduction in precision suffers, particularly for roads located near the borders as they might be wrongly classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to the initial example, let’s take the case of the external road, on the left side of the area. As you can see in Figure 6, it is clear that the road does not belong to our border. But when we apply the geohash approach it gets included into the middle geohash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/wrong-road-localisation.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 6 - Wrong road localisation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that just a small part of the geohash falls inside the border, the entire geohash will be classified as belonging to that area, and, as a consequence, the road that belongs to that geohash will be wrongly localised and we’ll end up adding the wrong localisation information to that road. This is clearly a consequence of the precision tradeoff. So, how can we solve this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="geohash-precision"&gt;Geohash precision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option is to increase the geohash precision. By using smaller and smaller geohashes, we can better reflect the actual area. As we go deeper and we further split the geohash, we can accurately follow the border. However, a high geohash precision also equates to a computationally intensive operation bringing us back to our initial situation. Therefore, it is crucial to find the right balance between the geohash size and the complexity of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/geohash-precision.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 7 - Geohash precision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="geohash-coverage-percentage"&gt;Geohash coverage percentage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find a balance between precision and data loss, we looked into calculating the geohash coverage percentage. For example, in Figure 8, the blue geohash is entirely within the border.  Here we can say that it has a 100% geohash coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/geohash-inside-border.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 8 - Geohash inside the border&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, take for example the geohash in Figure 9. It touches the border and has only around 80% of its surface inside the area. Given that most of its surface is within the border, we still can say that it belongs to the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/geohash-partial-border.png" style="width: 20%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 9 - Geohash partially inside the border&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at another example. In Figure 10, only a small part of the geohash is within the border. We can say that the geohash coverage percentage here is around 5%. For these cases, it becomes difficult for us to determine whether the geohash does belong to the area. What would be a good tradeoff in this case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/geohash-barely-border.png" style="width: 20%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 10 - Geohash barely inside the border&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="border-shape"&gt;Border shape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go one step further, we can consider a mixed solution, where we use the border shape but only for the geohashes touching the border. This would still be an intensive computational operation but the number of roads located in these geohashes will be much smaller, so it is still a gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the geohashes with full coverage inside the area, we’ll use the geohash for the localisation, the simpler operation. For the geohashes that are near the border, we’ll use a different approach. To increase the precision around the borders, we can cut the geohash following the  border’s shape. Instead of having a rectangle, we’ll use a more complex shape which is still simpler than the initial border shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/geohash-border-shape.png" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 11 - Geohash following a border’s shape&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="result"&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began with a simple approach and we enhanced it to improve precision. This also increased the complexity of the operation. We then asked, what are the actual gains? Was it worthwhile to go through all this process? In this section, we put this to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first created a benchmark by taking a small sample of the data and ran the localisation process on a laptop. The sample comprised approximately 2% of the borders and 0.0014% of the roads. We ran the localisation process using two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the first approach, we calculated the intersection between all the roads and borders. The entire operation took around 38 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the second approach, we optimised the operation using geohashes. In this approach, the runtime was only 78 seconds (1.3 minutes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that this is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The operation that we measured was the localisation of the roads but we did not include the border filling operation where we fill the borders with geohashes. This is because this operation does not need to be run every time. It can be run once and reused multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not often required, it is still crucial to understand and consider the operation of precomputing areas and filling borders with geohashes. The precomputation process depends on several factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number and shape of the borders - The more borders and the more complex the borders are, the longer the operation will take.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Geohash precision - How accurate do we need our localisation to be? The more accurate it needs to be, the longer it will take.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hardware availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to our hypothesis, although this precomputation might be expensive, it is rarely run as the borders don’t change often and can be triggered only when needed. However, regular computation, where we find the area to which each road belongs to, is often run as the roads change constantly. In our system, we run this localisation for each map processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also further optimise this process by applying the opposite approach. Geohashes that have full coverage inside a border can be merged together into larger geohashes thus simplifying the computation inside the border. In the end, we can have a solution that is fully optimised for our needs with the best cost-to-performance ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/optimised-geohash.png" style="width: 20%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 12 - Optimised geohashes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although geohashes seem to be the right solution for this kind of problem, we also need to monitor their content. One consideration is the road density inside a geohash. For example, a geohash inside a city centre usually has a lot of roads while one in the countryside may have much less. We need to consider this aspect to have a balanced computation operation and take full advantage of the big data approach. In our case, we achieve this balance by considering the number of road kilometres within a geohash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://engineering.grab.com/img/road-localisation-grabmaps/unbalanced-data.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption align="middle"&gt;Figure 13 - Unbalanced data&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the resources that we choose also matter. To optimise time and cost, we need to find the right balance between the running time and resource cost. As shown in Figure 14, based on a sample data we ran, sometimes, we get the best result when using smaller machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="post-image-section"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

      <title>OMG, I'm doing Drupal again</title>
      <link>https://chenhuijing.com/blog/omg-im-doing-drupal-again/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not written proper blog posts for a while now but I have come nearly full circle back to the start of my web career (albeit with a decade more experience and not necessarily any much smarter) to once again build a Drupal site. This is more a testament to the longevity of Drupal than my own career but that&amp;rsquo;s beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time for yet another “setting up Drupal from scratch” blog post, but this time for Drupal 10. Which means I completely skipped Drupal 9 but what hey. The backstory as to why I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post can be its own blog post itself, we&amp;rsquo;ll see. It&amp;rsquo;s Opinionated and mildly spicy IMHO and at my age, I&amp;rsquo;m too tired for conflict if I can avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oh-how-things-have-changed"&gt;Oh how things have changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I check back to the &lt;a href="https://chenhuijing.com/blog/revisiting-drupal-8-after-2-years"&gt;last Drupal-related blog post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote back in 2020, &lt;a href="https://getcomposer.org/"&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt; was already the new workflow for setting up new sites. So that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a surprise. But even before the actual Drupal stuff, there is the issue of environment setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that Docker-based solutions are the &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/local-server-setup"&gt;recommended development environment&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m not that big a fan so I went for the old school option of installing things on my local machine instead. Instructions here: &lt;a href="https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-sonoma-apache-multiple-php-versions"&gt;macOS 14.0 Sonoma Apache Setup: Multiple PHP Versions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the Drupal stuff, first things first, read and follow &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/getting-started/installing-drupal/get-the-code"&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer create-project drupal/recommended-project my_site_name_dir
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;For database management, I&amp;rsquo;m using a GUI tool called &lt;a href="https://sequel-ace.com/"&gt;Sequel Ace&lt;/a&gt; but you do you. The instructions on the documentation worked fine for me without issue, and I&amp;rsquo;m on MacOS Sonoma 14.1 at this point, so if you do run into problems, Google is your friend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my personal best practice for local Drupal development is to never have errors on the Status report page, even on local, and to always use a local &lt;em&gt;settings.php&lt;/em&gt; file. Copy the &lt;em&gt;example.settings.local.php&lt;/em&gt; file to the &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; folder and rename it &lt;em&gt;settings.local.php&lt;/em&gt;. Do the uncommenting on the bottom of the actual &lt;em&gt;settings.php&lt;/em&gt; file and you will see some new errors related to rebuild access and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you also have these problems, set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-php"&gt;$settings['skip_permissions_hardening'] = FALSE;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-php"&gt;$settings['rebuild_access'] = FALSE;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;in the settings.local.php file. (instructions from here: &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/social/issues/2853246"&gt;misreported settings.local.php and settings.php permissions in Status Report&lt;/a&gt;). You should then have a nice all-green Status report. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another basic setup thing I suggest doing is installing &lt;a href="https://www.drush.org/12.x/"&gt;Drush&lt;/a&gt;, which is a CLI for Drupal. It does not come out the box with Drupal hence we need to run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;composer require drush/drush
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You then call Drush via &lt;code&gt;vendor/bin/drush&lt;/code&gt; to run drush commands like clearing cache with &lt;code&gt;vendor/bin/drush cr&lt;/code&gt;. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to add &lt;code&gt;drush&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; but that somehow made this local installation of drush the global one, messing up my other site so I just left it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-bread-and-butter"&gt;My bread and butter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theming. That&amp;rsquo;s what pays my bills. Essentially, making websites look pretty. CSS (to a certain extent) does feed me and pay for my hobbies, so thanks, Håkon Wium Lie! I vaguely remember having something set up years ago as a starter theme but seeing that it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been updated for 5 years, that&amp;rsquo;s not really useful anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how Drupal 10 recommends we do this. Turns out there&amp;rsquo;s a thing called &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-themes/starterkit-theme"&gt;Starterkit theme&lt;/a&gt; which we can use to generate a brand new contrib theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;php core/scripts/drupal generate-theme my_new_theme
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drupal 10 uses Twig 3, so if your code editor doesn&amp;rsquo;t have support for that, installing an extension for &lt;code&gt;.twig&lt;/code&gt; files wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt. I went with &lt;a href="https://github.com/rholdos/vscode-twig-language-support/"&gt;vscode-twig-language-support&lt;/a&gt;, but again, you do you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest. I forgot EVERYTHING. But I did write some things down about Drupal 8 theming 3 years ago, so thank you past me. I think some of that stuff is still relevant, but let&amp;rsquo;s see if anything has changed much in Drupal 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="generate-a-new-theme"&gt;Generate a new theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember this being a thing back then but you can generate a theme from another starter theme with a command now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;php core/scripts/drupal generate-theme my_new_theme
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a theme that ships out the box called Starterkit theme which this command generates your custom theme from. I tried it, and it had essentially all the templates that you needed to override what was out of the box Drupal I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would need all that, given that my last starter theme was really barebones and based of the Stark theme (I think). So you can also use other themes for the generation, but you have to tweak the &lt;code&gt;*.info.yml&lt;/code&gt; file of Stark, setting &lt;code&gt;starterkit: true&lt;/code&gt;. Then running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;php core/scripts/drupal generate-theme --starterkit stark my_new_theme
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stark theme doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with much, so past me noted that adding a THEME_NAME.libraries.yml file is almost a mandatory exercise. This is the file that tells the theme where your styles and scripts are and refer to them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do the SCSS setup that I did all those years ago. Yet. I just want to see how far I can get without SCSS at this point. So the libraries file from back then still seems to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;global-styling:
version: 1.x
css:
theme:
css/styles.css: {}
js:
js/scripts.js: {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what this means is that the &lt;code&gt;styles.css&lt;/code&gt; file needs to be found in the &lt;em&gt;css&lt;/em&gt; folder and the &lt;code&gt;scripts.js&lt;/code&gt; file should exist in the &lt;em&gt;scripts&lt;/em&gt; folder as well. Also, when you make changes that may impact how the application locates and reads files, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to clear the cache. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="templating-pages"&gt;Templating pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal still uses the namespace override pattern for template files so things still felt familiar. According to my previous blog posts, I made use of &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/panels"&gt;Panels&lt;/a&gt; a lot but apparently that&amp;rsquo;s not a thing any more. And there&amp;rsquo;s a new thing called &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/layout-builder/layout-builder-overview"&gt;Layout Builder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long and short of things is that to customise the markup, you can override the system page templates by putting your own templates in your theme&amp;rsquo;s template folder. That&amp;rsquo;s way turning on &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/theming-drupal/twig-in-drupal/debugging-twig-templates"&gt;Twig debug mode&lt;/a&gt; is a very good idea. You can do that from the GUI now. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when you inspect your page, the debug tool helpfully tells you where the markup for each section is coming from, and makes suggestions on what you could name your overriding template to change things how you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Twig debugging tool activated in inspector" src="https://chenhuijing.com/assets/images/posts/drupal-10/twig-debug.png" /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this point, any further work depends on the actual site design you will be building so you&amp;rsquo;re on your own for that. The yet-to-be-written-maybe-never blogpost about the backstory of this entire endeavour might cover it. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live on and prosper, Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Back from blogging hiatus? Maybe…</title>
      <link>https://chenhuijing.com/blog/back-from-blogging-hiatus-maybe/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is with a sudden publication of blog posts after a seemingly indefinite hiatus? I have no answer except that I do things when I feel like it. More specifically, I do things that are not mandatory (like my job) when I feel like it. That&amp;rsquo;s why I still have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of jobs, to be honest, ever since the pandemic started in 2020, I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping a relatively low profile. Partly because I felt that a gazillion people were having a hard time because of it, but I was extremely lucky to retain gainful employment throughout that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like announcing to the whole world my employment status, you know what I mean? I was with Shopify for 3 years until they laid me off in May this year. Then I got picked up by the &lt;a href="https://interledger.org/"&gt;Interledger Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. And now &lt;a href="https://alexlakatos.com/about/"&gt;Alex Lakatos&lt;/a&gt; is my boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Myself and the Boss Man" src="https://chenhuijing.com/assets/images/posts/wut-is-dis/bossman-640.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet he regrets this hiring decision. But at least I&amp;rsquo;m reasonably competent at my job, which is building websites and making them pretty. So the bills are still getting paid. Thanks, bossman. Fun fact, he is still using the theme I helped create from 3 years ago (go click on the avocado on his profile photo in the About page).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="so-hows-life"&gt;So how&amp;rsquo;s life?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog has been around for quite a long time. I&amp;rsquo;ve never changed the domain name, nor have I changed the site&amp;rsquo;s design. The only major change was migrating from Jekyll to Hugo. But I still like my site design after all these years so that&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a couple of career “checkpoint” posts, &lt;a href="https://chenhuijing.com/blog/1827-days-working-on-the-web"&gt;the last one&lt;/a&gt; was written in 2018. I passed the 10-year mark of being a salaried web developer last month to absolutely no fanfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy working at the Interledger Foundation right now because I literally get to build websites as my main job (AWS is very unfortunately part of the deal, me sad). We are open source by nature, so everything is viewable on Github (me likey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of Interledger is to make sending payments as easy as sending an email. Interledger is a global interoperable network for financial services that implement &lt;a href="https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/interledger-protocol/"&gt;the Interledger Protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you never met me, I think a relatively accurate idea of how I am as a person can be summarised by &lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.com.sg/users/show/16527790"&gt;my AirBnb reviews&lt;/a&gt; (the most common descriptor is “clean/tidy”) and feedback from conference talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;Catching up on the talks I've missed, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hj_chen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@hj_chen&lt;/a&gt; opening talk so funny, I laugh til die, almost. But got learn new things. Moral of story, i18n is hard: Use a library please, check the numbers in CJK languages, and talk to your designers about the font stack for diff languages.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Shi Ling (@taishiling) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/taishiling/status/1684925855200694272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 28, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems like to some people, I&amp;rsquo;m reasonably entertaining, and also, I like to keep things organised. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that I standardised all our documentation sites to use &lt;a href="https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/"&gt;Starlight&lt;/a&gt;, which is built on &lt;a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/"&gt;Astro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="astro-is-your-shiny-new-toy-huh"&gt;Astro is your shiny new toy, huh?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in a way, yes. I&amp;rsquo;m currently at 7 Astro sites, 6 of which are Starlight (the other one isn&amp;rsquo;t for docs). It&amp;rsquo;s been fun learning the ins and outs of what it can do, largely because the &lt;a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; is great, and the &lt;a href="https://astro.build/chat"&gt;Discord community&lt;/a&gt; is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://interledger.org/developers/"&gt;developers section&lt;/a&gt; of the Interledger website, &lt;a href="https://rafiki.dev/"&gt;Rafiki documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://openpayments.guide/"&gt;OpenPayments documentation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://webmonetization.org/"&gt;Web Monetization documentation&lt;/a&gt; are all running on Starlight. I did not build the main Interledger.org, that is a different story which I may tell later. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more work to be done off this stable foundation of docs we&amp;rsquo;re trying to build out but it&amp;rsquo;s a good start I think. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about our family of docs, here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href="https://interledger.tech/"&gt;meta docs site&lt;/a&gt; about the docs sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interoperability of Astro with the most popular framework components is pretty cool as I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to port over React components from the previous implementation and have things work just fine. It does depend heavily on your use-case, but for mine, rewriting all the presentational React components to Astro felt great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did hold onto the React components that needed interactivity and state management but we do documentation, not some future-altering magical app that needs multi-dimensional data binding or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making my beautiful tech writers&amp;rsquo; lives easier, now that&amp;rsquo;s what I care about. I&amp;rsquo;m happy being the mechanism that the content writers and designers use to convert their output into a website. If there are particularly notable ways to implement something, I might write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or not. I&amp;rsquo;m very lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words are hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team is great though. And we got to meet in person multiple times this year. That&amp;rsquo;s more than I could say for my previous team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The Interledger tech team" src="https://chenhuijing.com/assets/images/posts/wut-is-dis/tech-team-640.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="see-you-around-maybe"&gt;See you around, maybe…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be more blog posts soon, or not-so-soon. I don&amp;rsquo;t plan my life. Who knows, I might be dead tomorrow (hopefully not, the handover will be chaotic since I haven&amp;rsquo;t documented everything properly yet). But in the meantime, we&amp;rsquo;d love it if you took some time to learn more about Interledger and its ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://rafiki.dev/introduction/overview/"&gt;Rafiki&lt;/a&gt;: open source software that allows an Account Servicing Entity to enable Interledger functionality on its users’ accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://openpayments.guide/introduction/overview/"&gt;OpenPayments&lt;/a&gt;: an open RESTful API and API standard that enables clients to interface with Open Payments-enabled accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/"&gt;Web Monetization&lt;/a&gt;: a proposed standard that allows your visitors to pay an amount of their choosing with little to no user interaction by enabling a website to automatically signal to web browsers that it can accept payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe, and remember to conserve water &lt;span class="emoji" tabindex="0"&gt;💧&lt;/span&gt; and electricity &lt;span class="emoji" tabindex="0"&gt;⚡&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Customising content markdown via frontmatter in Astro</title>
      <link>https://chenhuijing.com/blog/customising-content-markdown-via-frontmatter-in-astro/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The use case I had for this was to have customisable bits of a content collection that was rendered from markdown. Basically, a newsletter template where every newsletter could potentially have a different top banner and highlight colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to implement this but I went with this frontmatter approach because there might be situations where a non-technical person had to publish the newsletter, and asking them to pass variables into a component is more confusing for them than you&amp;rsquo;d think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you consult the &lt;a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#css-variables"&gt;Astro documentation on CSS variables&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to to pass CSS variables from component frontmatter using the &lt;code&gt;define:vars&lt;/code&gt; directive. If you think about it, isn&amp;rsquo;t frontend development all about passing data from one component to another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, how this would work for my use case is, on my newsletter layout, I can access the frontmatter props, assign them to variables. Then pass these server-side variables into the client &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-javascript"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;frontmatter&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;Astro&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;headerImg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;`url('&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;frontmatter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;header_img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;')`&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;gradientColour1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;frontmatter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;gradient_colour_1&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;gradientColour2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;frontmatter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;gradient_colour_2&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;headerTxt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;frontmatter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;header_txt&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;highlightColour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;frontmatter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;highlight_colour&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;"content-wrapper"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;"background-image: var(--header-img), linear-gradient(90deg, var(--gradient-colour-1) 0%, var(--gradient-colour-2) 100%); color: var(--header-txt)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;frontmatter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #960050; background-color: #1e0010;"&gt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;vars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;{{ &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;headerImg&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;gradientColour1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;gradientColour2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;headerTxt&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;highlightColour&lt;/span&gt; }}&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;headerTxt&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: #960050; background-color: #1e0010;"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;fff&lt;/span&gt;);
}
&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;) {
&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;highlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;highlightColour&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;pink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;lightest&lt;/span&gt;));
}
&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #960050; background-color: #1e0010;"&gt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the frontmatter on the markdown side of things would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;---
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;: ../../layouts/NewsletterLayout.astro
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;: Newsletter format of update email.
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;: Monthly update for July &lt;span style="color: #ae81ff;"&gt;2023&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;2023-07-01&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;gradient_colour_1&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;"yellow"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;gradient_colour_2&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;"limegreen"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;header_img&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;"/img/ernie.svg"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;header_txt&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;"#333"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;highlight_colour&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;"yellow"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;:
- newsletter
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that the frontmatter values have to exist, otherwise the site will error out. But they can be empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;---
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;: ../../layouts/NewsletterLayout.astro
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;: Acts as an archive.
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;: Monthly update for July &lt;span style="color: #ae81ff;"&gt;2023&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;2023-07-01&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;gradient_colour_1&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;gradient_colour_2&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;header_img&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;header_txt&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;highlight_colour&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #e6db74;"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;:
- newsletter
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this might cause the display to look weird, so to prevent that, we need to remember to add fallback to the CSS custom property values. The syntax for that looks like this, where the second argument of the &lt;code&gt;var()&lt;/code&gt; function is the fallback value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-css"&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;SELECTOR&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;span style="color: #75715e;"&gt;/* limegreen if --some-variable is not defined */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #a6e22e;"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;some&lt;span style="color: #f92672;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;variable, &lt;span style="color: #66d9ef;"&gt;limegreen&lt;/span&gt;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Took some time to fiddle around before figuring this one out, so it&amp;rsquo;s worth a short documentation for future me, as I&amp;rsquo;ve reached the stage in my career where I have to read my own blog posts to relearn how to solve problems I&amp;rsquo;ve solved before. &lt;span class="kaomoji"&gt;乁 ⁠(⁠ ⁠•⁠_⁠•⁠ ⁠)⁠ ㄏ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Four Tips for Improving Your API Gateway With Zero-Trust Methods</title>
      <link>https://nordicapis.com/four-tips-for-improving-your-api-gateway-with-zero-trust-methods/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=four-tips-for-improving-your-api-gateway-with-zero-trust-methods</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know that an API gateway is a critical component that acts as an intermediary between client applications and backend services within a microservices architecture. API gateways are essential elements of the full API lifecycle, particularly regarding the safety and security of your APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gateways provide a software layer that consolidates multiple APIs into a single endpoint, streamlining tasks like request composition, routing, and protocol translation. By managing API traffic and enforcing security policies, the API gateway provides centralized control, allowing developers to focus on building individual services without being burdened by intricate API networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API gateways offer an array of features, including efficient API traffic management, protocol translation, caching, and load balancing. These features empower businesses to streamline incoming requests, automatically translate protocols for effortless client interaction, cache frequently used data for optimized performance, and distribute traffic among multiple backend instances to enhance scalability and availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we know they&amp;#8217;re important… but how do we ensure we&amp;#8217;re maximizing security on our API gateway of choice? The main concept I like to keep in mind is &amp;#8216;&lt;a href="https://www.getambassador.io/blog/the-importance-of-zero-trust"&gt;zero trust&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8217; In a zero-trust model, trust is never assumed — it must be continuously verified, ensuring the security and legitimacy of every interaction with the API gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero trust is a powerful security model that helps companies improve their security posture, increase efficiency, and meet compliance requirements. Embracing a &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/understanding-the-need-for-zero-trust-architecture/"&gt;zero-trust security model&lt;/a&gt; means adopting certain technologies, ways of working, and policies that support business agility while enhancing security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding on the zero trust idea within your API gateway, here are four tips for getting zero trust security right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-first-things-first-authentication"&gt;1. First Things First: Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication is a foundational aspect of API gateways. As the primary interface between external entities and internal services, the API gateway&amp;#8217;s ability to securely authenticate requests is pivotal for overall system security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, authentication ensures that the entity making the request is indeed who they claim to be. While API keys can be used for authentication, token-based systems like &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/how-oauth-enables-a-zero-trust-architecture/"&gt;OAuth 2.0&lt;/a&gt; offer granular permissions, allowing specific actions or resource access based on the token&amp;#8217;s claims. Token-based authentication, especially with stateless tokens like JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), eliminates the need for the server to maintain a session state, making it suitable for large-scale, distributed applications. These tokens can also be signed and encrypted to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. For example, JWTs allow claims to be embedded directly into the token, which the server can validate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To minimize the impact of token leaks or theft, it&amp;#8217;s advisable to keep token lifespans short and use refresh tokens when necessary. Token-based authentication is widely adopted and understood, simplifying integration with third-party services or systems. However, it&amp;#8217;s important to note that even the best practices can introduce vulnerabilities if poorly implemented. Proper key management, secure token transmission (such as using HTTPS), token signature validation, and safeguarding against token reuse are all critical aspects of this practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2-but-don-t-forget-authorization"&gt;2. But Don&amp;#8217;t Forget Authorization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of authorization, the API gateway acts as an intermediary that checks each request against a set of permissions before allowing it to proceed. API gateways often serve multiple applications, user roles, and services, leading to a diverse range of interactions. Not every authenticated entity should have access to all resources. For instance, a regular employee should not have the same data access rights as an administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing the &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/what-is-the-principle-of-least-privilege/"&gt;principle of least privilege&lt;/a&gt; by enforcing &lt;a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/role-based-access-control-RBAC"&gt;role-based access control (RBAC)&lt;/a&gt; strictly for all API endpoints ensures that each user or service is granted only the permissions necessary for their specific role or task. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or actions, enhancing the overall security of the API gateway and the microservices it safeguards. In case a user or service credential is compromised, RBAC ensures that the attacker can only access limited resources, limiting potential damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By granting permissions based on roles, only the minimum necessary access is provided, aligning with the principle of least privilege. A robust RBAC approach ensures that every user or service interacts only with the resources they genuinely require, thus improving overall system security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3-get-rate-limiting-right"&gt;3. Get Rate Limiting Right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-api-rate-limiting/"&gt;Rate limiting&lt;/a&gt; not only ensures system availability during normal use but also serves as a primary defense against various malicious activities, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. By capping the number of requests from a specific source or to a particular endpoint, an API gateway can effectively prevent a flood of requests from overwhelming the backend infrastructure, maintaining continuous service availability for legitimate users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striking the right balance between legitimate requests and malicious actors is crucial. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all rate limit, consider a dynamic approach that allows you to adjust limits based on user or client behavior. For example, a user with typical behavior might be allowed more requests than a user exhibiting suspicious activity. To achieve this, use a layered approach to rate limits, including IP-based limits, user ID or token-based limits, endpoint-specific limits, and contextual limits based on the request type (such as read-only or data-modifying requests). This approach ensures that genuine users receive high-quality service, while potential attackers find it challenging to execute brute-force, scraping, or DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, be cautious that rate limiting does not inadvertently block legitimate traffic or lead to a denial-of-service scenario for genuine users. It&amp;#8217;s important to accompany rate limiting with proper monitoring and alerting mechanisms to promptly address any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Kubernetes developers specifically (sorry, I&amp;#8217;m biased since I come from that world), rate limiting becomes even more important. Kubernetes enables dynamic scaling of containers and microservices to handle varying workloads. However, without rate limiting at the API gateway level, these dynamically scaled services can be susceptible to excessive traffic spikes, leading to resource exhaustion. Rate limiting acts as a safeguard, ensuring that regardless of how Kubernetes scales, your services remain protected and operate within their intended capacity limits!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4-don-t-forget-the-importance-of-logging-and-monitoring"&gt;4. Don&amp;#8217;t Forget the Importance of Logging and Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging within API gateways involves capturing relevant information about requests and responses passing through the gateway. This information typically includes timestamps, source IP addresses, endpoints accessed, response times, status codes, headers, payloads, query parameters, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s critical to gain insights into API traffic and errors with comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities. The &lt;a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/"&gt;Four Golden Signals&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start monitoring service health, including latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. At the very least, if you&amp;#8217;re keeping a pulse on the four golden signals and alerting your team if one signal is problematic or about to be problematic, you&amp;#8217;re more than halfway there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, monitoring latency helps you understand how long requests take to be processed. High latency can indicate performance issues and negatively impact user experience. By tracking latency metrics, you can identify bottlenecks, optimize service response times, and ensure a responsive API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective monitoring can also identify potential system bottlenecks, service degradations, or malicious activities. For instance, a sudden increase in failed login attempts or requests from a specific IP range could indicate a brute-force attack or potential API abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bonus-tip-think-about-what-your-api-gateway-is-built-on"&gt;Bonus Tip: Think About What Your API Gateway Is Built On&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this tip doesn&amp;#8217;t have as much to do with the zero-trust approach as it does with personal preference, but it&amp;#8217;s still worth noting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many developers prefer NGINX, which is a traditional proxy that was initially designed as a web server as it is very reliable for static content or basic ingress. Many now consider it a legacy platform as it can be less dynamic than more modern solutions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/envoy-proxy"&gt;Envoy Proxy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envoy Proxy has been deployed in production by some of the largest technology companies globally, including Lyft, Apple, and Google. Tasks such as hot restarts and managing connections are easier for something like Envoy Proxy to do with ease. And because Envoy Proxy is the lynchpin in these large companies&amp;#8217; networks, it is well-maintained and regularly gains new features, like HTTP/3 support. Consider the needs of your developer team and what option makes the most sense when choosing your API gateway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-the-end-zero-trust-approach-improves-user-trust-100-"&gt;In the End: Zero Trust Approach Improves User Trust 100%&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nordicapis.com/api-gateway-best-practices-to-improve-security/"&gt;secure API gateway&lt;/a&gt; ensures a better experience for your trusted users. By effectively filtering out unauthorized and malicious requests, system resources are allocated more efficiently, resulting in faster response times, consistent uptime, and a more reliable user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased security measures via the zero-trust approach provide your consumers with confidence, knowing that their data is protected against potential breaches. Adding these security measures to your API gateway can be as simple as making a configuration change in your YAML file or as complex as a full &amp;#8216;shift left&amp;#8217; in your security measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, progress makes perfect (eventually!). Of course, no security model is perfect, but the zero-trust security model is among today&amp;#8217;s most effective models, and it should absolutely be infused into your API gateway strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is an Online Browser?</title>
      <link>https://catonmat.net/what-is-an-online-browser</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TLDR: A demo speaks louder than a thousand words. You can open an online browser created by me and my team via &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com/browse"&gt;browserling.com/browse&lt;/a&gt;. We run online browsers on our servers and stream just the browser window to you. No cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Browser – What Is It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An online browser is a browser that runs on a remote server in the cloud, rather than locally on a user's computer. This setup allows for enhanced security and privacy, as an online browser isolates web activities from the user's local browsing activities, thereby reducing the risk of malware infections, tracking, and accidental data breaches. Additionally, online browsers can offer improved performance and accessibility, as they can be accessed from various devices without the need for specific software configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Browser Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online browsers have dozens of use cases that include secure web browsing, accessing region-restricted content, safe browsing on public networks, testing websites across different browsers and devices, anonymous browsing, checking malware links, verifying shortened URLs, safe exploration of unsafe websites, educational and training uses in cybersecurity, and remote access and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing Websites Across Different Browsers and Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web developers and testers can use online browsers to test websites and applications across different browser types and versions without having to install multiple browsers on their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Verifying Shortened URLs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortened links, often used in social media and email communications, can be risky as they obscure the final destination URL. Online browsers allow users to safely expand and verify these URLs without directly exposing their system to potential harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Safe Exploration of Unsafe Websites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When researching or accessing websites known for being insecure or hosting questionable content, an online browser can serve as a shield, preventing direct contact between these websites and the user's device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Checking Malware Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online browsers provide a safe environment to check links suspected of containing malware. By opening these links in a cloud-based browser, users can protect their local devices from being infected, as the browser isolates potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Safe Browsing on Public Networks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For individuals using public Wi-Fi networks, such as in cafes or airports, online browsers provide a secure browsing experience. They prevent potential cyber threats that might arise from unsecured public networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anonymous Browsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online browsers can offer a degree of anonymity, as they can mask the user's IP address and browsing activities from ISPs and local networks. This is particularly useful for users who prioritize privacy and wish to avoid tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accessing Region-Restricted Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can utilize online browsers to access web content that may be restricted in their geographical location. Since these browsers can operate from servers located in different countries, they allow users to bypass regional content restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Remote Access and Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams working remotely can use online browsers for collaborative browsing sessions. This allows multiple users to view and interact with the same browser session in real-time, which is useful for collaborative research, web-based training, or joint decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preserving Bandwidth and Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online browsers are beneficial for users with limited computing resources or bandwidth. Since the processing is done on remote servers, it reduces the load on the user's device and conserves local bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accessibility for Older or Less Capable Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users with older or less capable hardware can benefit from online browsers, as these do not require high processing power or advanced hardware capabilities, enabling access to modern web applications and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Browser via Browserling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can instantly access an online browser via Browserling. &lt;a href="https://www.browserling.com"&gt;Browserling&lt;/a&gt; is an online browser service that operates by providing users with access to virtualized web browsers that run on remote servers. This setup enables users to securely and anonymously browse the Internet, inspect potentially harmful links, access region-restricted content, and limit the exposure of their local devices to security risks. Browserling also serves as a valuable tool for web developers and testers, allowing them to check website compatibility across different browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer) and operating systems (such as Windows, MacOS, Android, and Linux) without needing to install multiple browsers and systems locally.  The service's cloud-based nature ensures that it can be accessed from various devices, making it a versatile solution for users with limited bandwidth or computing resources, as well as those using older or less capable devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy browsing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scrum Your Money, Part 1: Values</title>
      <link>https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/11/17/scrum-your-money-values/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This Scrum Your Money series was inspired by previous Atomic Object blog posts: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2023/09/03/sprint-based-backlogs/?utm_source=general-ao&amp;amp;utm_medium=slack&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sprint-based-backlogs"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Embracing Sprint-Based Backlogs to Prepare our Home for Sale by October&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/03/31/agile-practices-backlog/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Agile Practices for Normal Life – Building a Backlog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Scrum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love using Scrum principles to accomplish big goals and projects outside of work. So, in this series, I’ll cover how you can apply the scrum concepts to your personal finances too! By embracing scrum, you&amp;#8217;ll equip yourself with the tools and mindset to reach your money goals faster. &lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. Please discuss your specific situation with a financial advisor. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, I didn’t come from money, and I’ve learned a lot from my money missteps. I accept that I have my own cognitive biases and goals for my money that probably don’t align with yours.  After all, personal finance is personal. There is a ton of emotion tied to money based on how you were raised, what your parents taught you, and money discussions you observed (or didn’t). You are allowed to grow and change and make different decisions as you learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t tell you how to make or spend your money, but I will share some highly adaptable tools to elevate your money game. This series is for anyone new to budgeting, getting out of debt, starting to invest, or saving up for a big purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scrum Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software development team’s success with scrum depends on five values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect. &lt;a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html"&gt;The Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt; states: &amp;#8220;The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this apply to personal finance? You can adapt the Scrum values to your money team: yourself, your family, or a partner or spouse. I make financial decisions with my spouse, so our scrum money values would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We commit to achieving our money goals and to supporting each other. Our primary focus each month is to make the best possible progress toward our money goals. We&amp;#8217;re open about the emotional work and the challenges that will arise as we figure out our money. We respect each other to be capable, independent people. We have the courage to work on our tough money problems.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These money values are profoundly positive and actionable! Take a moment to tweak this value statement to your situation and refer to it as often as needed as a reminder of your commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scrum Your Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying scrum principles to your personal finances is an empowering and transformative approach to achieving financial success. Scrum underscores the importance of starting without exhaustive knowledge and emphasizes the value of continuous learning through experience and observation. The key takeaway is that you can evolve and make different decisions as you learn and grow. Moreover, when you scrum your money, you establish a positive and actionable framework for achieving your money goals, fostering collaboration, and addressing financial challenges head-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; The term "data" has gained significant prominence recently, leading to the emergence of numerous fields of study and job positions. Now, we encounter terms such as Data Strategy, Data Culture, Data Governance, Data Driven, Data Lake, Data Warehouse, and Big Data. But what does each of these terms mean?

      <title>How to execute an object file: Part 4, AArch64 edition</title>
      <link>http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-4/</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img alt="How to execute an object file: Part 4, AArch64 edition" class="kg-image" height="1125" src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/11/image1-1.png" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translating source code written in a high-level programming language into an executable binary typically involves a series of steps, namely compiling and assembling the code into object files, and then linking those object files into the final executable. However, there are certain scenarios where it can be useful to apply an alternate approach that involves executing object files directly, bypassing the linker. For example, we might use it for malware analysis or when part of the code requires an incompatible compiler. We’ll be focusing on the latter scenario: when one of our libraries needed to be compiled differently from the rest of the code. Learning how to execute an object file directly will give you a much better sense of how code is compiled and linked together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate how this was done, we have previously published a series of posts on executing an object file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-1/"&gt;How to execute an object file: Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-2/"&gt;How to execute an object file: Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-3/"&gt;How to execute an object file: Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial posts are dedicated to the x86 architecture. Since then the fleet of our working machines has expanded to include a large and growing number of ARM CPUs. This time we’ll repeat this exercise for the aarch64 architecture. You can pause here to read the previous blog posts before proceeding with this one, or read through the brief summary below and reference the earlier posts for more detail. We might reiterate some theory as working with ELF files can be daunting, if it’s not your day-to-day routine. Also, please be mindful that for simplicity, these examples omit bounds and integrity checks. Let the journey begin!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to obtain an object file or an executable binary from a high-level compiled programming language the code needs to be processed by three components: compiler, assembler and linker. The compiler generates an assembly listing. This assembly listing is picked up by the assembler and translated into an object file. All source files, if a program contains multiple, go through these two steps generating an object file for each source file. At the final step the linker unites all object files into one binary, additionally resolving references to the shared libraries (i.e. we don’t implement the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function each time, rather we take it from a system library). Even though the approach is platform independent, the compiler output varies by platform as the assembly listing is closely tied to the CPU architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) can run each step: compiler, assembler and linker separately for us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;main.c:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-cpp"&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int main(void)
{
	puts(&amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;);
	return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiler (output &lt;code&gt;main.s&lt;/code&gt; - assembly listing):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gcc -S main.c
$ ls
main.c  main.s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assembler (output &lt;code&gt;main.o&lt;/code&gt; - an object file):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gcc -c main.s -o main.o
$ ls
main.c  main.o  main.s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linker (&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; - an object file):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gcc main.o -o main
$ ls
main  main.c  main.o  main.s
$ ./main
Hello, world!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the examples assume gcc is running on a native aarch64 architecture or include a cross compilation flag for those who want to reproduce and have no aarch64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have two object files in the output above: &lt;code&gt;main.o&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;. Object files are files encoded with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format"&gt;ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)&lt;/a&gt; standard. Although, &lt;code&gt;main.o&lt;/code&gt; is an ELF file, it doesn’t contain all the information to be fully executable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ file main.o
main.o: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped

$ file main
main: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically
linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1,
BuildID[sha1]=d3ecd2f8ac3b2dec11ed4cc424f15b3e1f130dd4, for GNU/Linux 3.7.0, not stripped
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-elf-file"&gt;The ELF File&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central idea of this series of blog posts is to understand how to resolve dependencies from object files without directly involving the linker. For illustrative purposes we generated an object file based on some C-code and used it as a library for our main program. Before switching to the code, we need to understand the basics of the ELF structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each ELF file is made up of one &lt;em&gt;ELF header&lt;/em&gt;, followed by file data. The data can include: a &lt;em&gt;program header&lt;/em&gt; table, a &lt;em&gt;section header&lt;/em&gt; table, and the data which is referred to by the program or section header tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-elf-header"&gt;The ELF Header&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ELF header provides some basic information about the file: what architecture the file is compiled for, the program entry point and the references to other tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ELF Header:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ readelf -h main
ELF Header:

  Number of section headers:         29
  Section header string table index: 28
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-elf-program-header"&gt;The ELF Program Header&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The execution process of almost every program starts from an auxiliary program, called loader, which arranges the memory and calls the program’s entry point. In the following output the loader is marked with a line &lt;code&gt;“Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1”&lt;/code&gt;. The whole program memory is split into different segments with associated size, permissions and type (which instructs the loader on how to interpret this block of memory). Because the execution process should be performed in the shortest possible time, the &lt;em&gt;sections&lt;/em&gt; with the same characteristics and located nearby are grouped into bigger blocks — &lt;em&gt;segments&lt;/em&gt; — and placed in the &lt;em&gt;program header&lt;/em&gt;. We can say that the &lt;em&gt;program header&lt;/em&gt; summarizes the types of data that appear in the &lt;em&gt;section header&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ELF Program Header:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ readelf -Wl main

&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-elf-section-header"&gt;The ELF Section Header&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the source code of high-level languages, variables, functions, and constants are mixed together. However, in assembly you might see that the data and instructions are separated into different blocks. The ELF file content is divided in an even more granular way. For example, variables with initial values are placed into different sections than the uninitialized ones. This approach optimizes for space, otherwise the values for uninitialized variables would be filled with zeros. Along with the space efficiency, there are security reasons for stratification — executable instructions can’t have writable permissions, while memory containing variables can't be executable. The section header describes each of these sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ELF Section Header:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ readelf -SW main

Without the names we can’t identify them. However, having an additional character field for each section in the ELF structure would be inefficient for the space — it must be limited by some maximum length and those names which are shorter would leave the space unfilled. Instead, ELF provides an additional section, &lt;code&gt;.shstrtab&lt;/code&gt;. This string table concatenates all the names where each name ends with a null terminated byte. We can iterate over the names and match with an offset held by other sections to reference their name. But how do we find &lt;code&gt;.shstrtab&lt;/code&gt; itself if we don’t have a name? To solve this chicken and egg problem, the ELF program header provides a direct pointer to &lt;code&gt;.shstrtab&lt;/code&gt;. The similar approach is applied to two other sections: &lt;code&gt;.symtab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.strtab&lt;/code&gt;. Where &lt;code&gt;.symtab&lt;/code&gt; contains all information about the symbols and &lt;code&gt;.strtab&lt;/code&gt; holds the list of symbol names. In the code we work with these tables to resolve all their dependencies and find our functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="executing-example-from-part-2-on-aarch64"&gt;Executing example from Part 2 on aarch64&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-2/"&gt;second blog post&lt;/a&gt; we made the function &lt;code&gt;add10&lt;/code&gt; depend on &lt;code&gt;add5&lt;/code&gt; instead of being self-contained. This is the first time when we faced relocations. &lt;em&gt;Relocations&lt;/em&gt; is the process of loading symbols defined outside the current scope. The relocated symbols can present global or thread-local variables, constant, functions, etc. We’ll start from checking assembly instructions which trigger relocations and uncovering how the ELF format handles them in a more general way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After making &lt;code&gt;add10&lt;/code&gt; depend on &lt;code&gt;add5&lt;/code&gt; our aarch64 version stopped working as well, similarly to the x86. Let’s take a look at assembly listing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ objdump --disassemble --section=.text obj.o

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed that all the hex values in the second column are exactly the same length, in contrast with the instructions lengths seen for x86 in Part 2 of our series? This is because all Armv8-A instructions are presented in 32 bits. Since it is impossible to encode every immediate value into less than 32 bits, some operations require more than one instruction, as we’ll see later. For now, we’re interested in one instruction &lt;code&gt;- bl&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2021-12/Base-Instructions/BL--Branch-with-Link-?lang=en"&gt;branch with link&lt;/a&gt;) on rows &lt;code&gt;28&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;34&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;bl&lt;/code&gt; is a “jump” instruction, but before the jump it preserves the next instruction after the current one in the link register (&lt;code&gt;lr&lt;/code&gt;). When the callee finishes execution the caller address is recovered from &lt;code&gt;lr&lt;/code&gt;. Usually, the aarch64 instructions reserve the last 6 bits [31:26] for opcode and some auxiliary fields such as running architecture (32 or 64 bits), condition flag and others. Remaining bits are shared between arguments like source register, destination register and immediate value. Since the &lt;code&gt;bl&lt;/code&gt; instruction does not require a source or destination register, the full 26 bits can be used to encode the immediate offset instead. However, 26 bits can only encode a small range (+/-32 MB), but because the jump can only target a beginning of an instruction, it must always be aligned to 4 bytes, which increases the effective range of the encoded immediate fourfold, to +/-128 MB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly to what we did in &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-2/"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; we’re going to resolve our relocations - first by manually calculating the correct addresses and then by using an approach similar to what the linker does. The current value of our &lt;code&gt;bl&lt;/code&gt; instruction is &lt;code&gt;94000000&lt;/code&gt; or in binary representation &lt;code&gt;100101&lt;strong&gt;00000000000000000000000000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. All 26 bits are zeros, so we don't jump anywhere. The address is calculated by an offset from the current &lt;em&gt;program counter&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;pc&lt;/code&gt;), which can be positive or negative. In our case we expect it to be &lt;code&gt;-0x28&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-0x34&lt;/code&gt;. As described above, it should be divided by 4 and taken as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement"&gt;two's complements&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;-0x28 / 4 = -0xA == 0xFFFFFFF6&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-0x34 / 4 = -0xD == 0xFFFFFFF3&lt;/code&gt;. From these values we need to take the lower 26 bits and concatenate them with the initial 6 bits to get the final instruction. So, the final ones will be: &lt;code&gt;100101&lt;strong&gt;11111111111111111111110110&lt;/strong&gt; == 0x97FFFFF6&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;100101&lt;strong&gt;11111111111111111111110011&lt;/strong&gt; == 0x97FFFFF3&lt;/code&gt;. Have you noticed that all the distance calculations are done relative to the &lt;code&gt;bl&lt;/code&gt; (or current &lt;code&gt;pc&lt;/code&gt;), not the next instruction as in x86?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s add to the code and execute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-cpp"&gt;...

&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works! But this is not how the linker handles the relocations. The linker resolves relocation based on the type and formula assigned to this type. In our &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-2/"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; we investigated it quite well. Here again we need to find the type and check the formula for this type: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ readelf --relocs obj.o

&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see that all &lt;code&gt;adrp&lt;/code&gt; instructions are followed by &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instructions. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2021-12/Base-Instructions/ADD--immediate---Add--immediate--?lang=en"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; instruction adds an immediate value to the source register and writes the result to the destination register. The source and destination registers can be the same, the immediate value is 12 bits. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2021-12/Base-Instructions/ADRP--Form-PC-relative-address-to-4KB-page-?lang=en"&gt;adrp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; instruction generates a &lt;code&gt;pc&lt;/code&gt;-relative (program counter) address and writes the result to the destination register. It takes &lt;code&gt;pc&lt;/code&gt; of the instruction itself and adds a 21-bit immediate value shifted left by 12 bits. If the immediate value weren’t shifted it would lie in a range of +/-1 MB memory, which isn’t enough. The left shift increases the range up to +/-1 GB. However, because the 12 bits are masked out with the shift, we need to store them somewhere and restore later. That’s why we see add instruction following &lt;code&gt;adrp&lt;/code&gt; and two types instead of one. Also, it’s a bit tricky to encode &lt;a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2021-12/Base-Instructions/ADRP--Form-PC-relative-address-to-4KB-page-?lang=en"&gt;&lt;code&gt;adrp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: 2 low bits of immediate value are placed in the position 30:29 and the rest in the position 23:5. Due to size limitations, the aarch64 instructions try to make the most out of 32 bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the code we are going to use the formulas to calculate the values and description of &lt;code&gt;adrp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instructions to obtain the final opcode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-cpp"&gt;#define R_AARCH64_CALL26 283

The final code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/tree/master/2021-03-obj-file/4/2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="executing-example-from-part-3-on-aarch64"&gt;Executing example from Part 3 on aarch64&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-3/"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; is about resolving external dependencies. When we write code we don’t think much about how to allocate memory or print debug information to the console. Instead, we involve functions from the system libraries. But the code of system libraries needs to be passed through to our programs somehow. Additionally, for optimization purposes, it would be nice if this code would be stored in one place and shared between all programs. And another wish — we don’t want to resolve all the functions and global variables from the libraries, only those which we need and at those times when we need them. To solve these problems, ELF introduced two sections: PLT (the procedure linkage table) and GOT (the global offset table). The dynamic loader creates a list which contains all external functions and variables from the shared library, but doesn’t resolve them immediately; instead they are placed in the PLT section. Each external symbol is presented by a small function, a stub, e.g. &lt;code&gt;puts@plt&lt;/code&gt;. When an external symbol is requested, the stub checks if it was resolved previously. If not, the stub searches for an absolute address of the symbol, returns to the requester and writes it in the GOT table. The next time, the address returns directly from the GOT table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-3/"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; we implemented a simplified PLT/GOT resolution. Firstly, we added a new function &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2021-03-obj-file/3/obj.c#L35"&gt;&lt;code&gt;say_hello&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;obj.c&lt;/code&gt;, which calls unresolved system library function &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt;. Further we added an optional wrapper &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2021-03-obj-file/3/loader.c#L73"&gt;&lt;code&gt;my_puts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;loader.c&lt;/code&gt;. The wrapper isn’t required, we could’ve resolved directly to a standard function, but it's a good example of how the implementation of some functions can be overwritten with custom code. In the next steps we added our PLT/GOT resolution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLT section we replaced with a &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2021-03-obj-file/3/loader.c#L340"&gt;jumptable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GOT we replaced with &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-blog/blob/master/2021-03-obj-file/3/loader.c#L238-L248"&gt;assembly instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, we created a small stub with assembly code (our &lt;code&gt;jumptable&lt;/code&gt;) to resolve the global address of our &lt;code&gt;my_puts&lt;/code&gt; wrapper and jump to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach for aarch64 is the same. But the &lt;code&gt;jumptable&lt;/code&gt; is very different as it consists of different assembly instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big difference here compared to the other parts is that we need to work with a 64-bit address for the GOT resolution. Our custom PLT or &lt;code&gt;jumptable&lt;/code&gt; is placed close to the main code of &lt;code&gt;obj.c&lt;/code&gt; and can operate with the relative addresses as before. For the GOT or referencing &lt;code&gt;my_puts&lt;/code&gt; wrapper we’ll use different branch instructions — &lt;a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2021-12/Base-Instructions/BR--Branch-to-Register-"&gt;&lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2021-12/Base-Instructions/BLR--Branch-with-Link-to-Register-"&gt;&lt;code&gt;blr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These instructions branch to the register, where the aarch64 registers can hold 64-bit values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can check how it resolves with the native PLT/GOT in our loader assembly code:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ objdump --disassemble --section=.text loader

1d30:	f94017e0 	ldr	x0, [sp, #40]
1d34:	d63f0000 	blr	x0
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first instruction is &lt;code&gt;bl&lt;/code&gt; jump to &lt;code&gt;puts@plt&lt;/code&gt; stub. The next &lt;a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2021-12/Base-Instructions/LDR--immediate---Load-Register--immediate--"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instruction tells us that some value was loaded into the register &lt;code&gt;x0&lt;/code&gt; from the stack. Each function has its own &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#Stack_and_frame_pointers"&gt;stack frame&lt;/a&gt; to hold the local variables. The last &lt;code&gt;blr&lt;/code&gt; instruction makes a jump to the address stored in &lt;code&gt;x0&lt;/code&gt; register. There is an agreement in the register naming: if the stored value is 64-bits then the register is called &lt;code&gt;x0-x30&lt;/code&gt;; if only 32-bits are used then it’s called &lt;code&gt;w0-w30&lt;/code&gt; (the value will be stored in the lower 32-bits and upper 32-bits will be zeroed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to do something similar — place the absolute address of our &lt;code&gt;my_puts&lt;/code&gt; wrapper in some register and call &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; on this register. We don’t need to store the link before branching, the call will be returned to &lt;code&gt;say_hello&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;obj.c&lt;/code&gt;, which is why a plain &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; will be enough. Let’s check an assembly of simple C-function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hello.c:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-cpp"&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;

The documentation says that there are only 16 bits for the immediate value, but a shift can be applied (in our case left shift &lt;code&gt;lsl&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we can’t use &lt;code&gt;x0&lt;/code&gt; in our context.

Let’s use &lt;code&gt;x9&lt;/code&gt; then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to modify our loader.

We gave a brief introduction on how the binary got executed on Linux and how all components are linked together. We saw a big difference between x86 and aarch64 assembly. We learned how we can hook into the code and change its behavior. But just as it was said in the first blog post of this series, the most important thing is to remember to always think about security first. Processing external inputs should always be done with great care. Bounds and integrity checks have been omitted for the purposes of keeping the examples short, so readers should be aware that the code is not production ready and is designed for educational purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inventory management on Black Friday: Challenges and solutions</title>
      <link>https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/inventory-management-challenges-solutions/</link>
      <description>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are like the Superbowl for retailers. Instead of point spreads, though, e-commerce companies are betting on peak sales numbers.
But while the deluge of deals evokes dreams of dollars for CEOs, the surging site traffic can be more of a nightmare for CTOs. The onslaught of shoppers puts huge amounts of stress on their application architecture. In this scenario, even a minor problem with inventory management can cause major consequences.</description>

      <title>Grease Pencil: Task Force</title>
      <link>https://code.blender.org/2023/11/grease-pencil-task-force/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://code.blender.org/2023/05/the-next-big-step-grease-pencil-3-0/"&gt;Grease Pencil 3 project&lt;/a&gt; is well on its way, but there are still many tasks left to do. This is a call to the Blender community to help out and get Grease Pencil 3 out of experimental mode!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a class="is-heading-anchor" href="https://code.blender.org/feed/#what-is-needed"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-needed"&gt;What is needed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Development and testing. The main priority is to get feature parity with the current Grease Pencil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Edit Mode, we are still missing most of the operators. There is &lt;a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/112858" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a list of tasks&lt;/a&gt; targeted towards newcomers to help port these operators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a class="is-heading-anchor" href="https://code.blender.org/feed/#how-to-help"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-help"&gt;How to help?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/114158" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Overview Task&lt;/a&gt; has a brief description on how to get started as a developer as well as a list of tasks to work on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are not a developer, you are still welcome to test Grease Pencil 3.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab the latest alpha build of Blender 4.1&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable it from the preferences under &lt;strong&gt;Experimental&lt;/strong&gt; (once &lt;strong&gt;Developers Extra&lt;/strong&gt; is enabled in &amp;ldquo;Interface&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please note that the 2D Animation template doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with Grease Pencil 3, and any tests should be done on new files, since older Grease Pencil objects will not get converted to the new system yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6.png?x93256"&gt;&lt;img alt="Enable Grease Pencil 3 from the Preferences editor, under Experimental (once Developers Extra is enabled in Interface)." class="wp-image-11349" height="686" src="https://code.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-1024x686.png?x93256" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

      <title>The theory behind the IHttpFilter interface</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231117-00/?p=109028</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Windows Runtime has an interface called &lt;code&gt;IHttpFilter&lt;/code&gt; that lets you customize how HTTP requests are processed. The system has a default implementation called &lt;code&gt;Http­Base­Protocol­Filter&lt;/code&gt;, and if it has the features you need, then you&amp;#8217;re all set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;auto filter = HttpBaseProtocolFilter();
filter.AllowAutoRedirect(false); // disable auto-redirect
auto client = HttpClient(filter);
⟦ Use the client ⟧
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe you want to do something beyond that. For example, maybe you want a filter that injects an extra header into each request. You can implement these extra features by providing your own implementation of &lt;code&gt;IHttpFilter&lt;/code&gt;, using the default implementation to do the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;// IDL
runtimeclass ExtraHeadersHttpFilter : Windows.Web.Http.Filters.IHttpFilter
{
    ExtraHeadersHttpFilter();
    void AddHeader(string name, string value);
}

// Implementation

struct ExtraHeadersHttpFilter : ExtraHeadersHttpFilterT&amp;lt;ExtraHeadersHttpFilter&amp;gt;
{
    using namespace Http = winrt::Windows::Web::Http;
private:
    // Data members
    std::mutex m_mutex;
    std::unordered_map&amp;lt;winrt::hstring, winrt::hstring&amp;gt; m_extraHeaders;
    Http::Filters::HttpBaseProtocolFilter m_base = Http:Filters::HttpBaseProtocolFilter();

public:
    ExtraHeadersHttpFilter() = default;

    // Bonus methods for public consumption
    void AddHeader(winrt::hstring const&amp;amp; name,
                   winrt::hstring const&amp;amp; value)
    {
        auto lock = std::lock_guard(m_mutex);
        m_extraHeaders.insert_or_assign(name, value);
    }

    // IHttpFilter methods
    winrt::Windows::Foundation::IAsyncOperationWithProgress&amp;lt;Http::HttpResponseMessage,
        Http::HttpProgress&amp;gt; SendRequestAsync(Http::HttpRequestMessage request)
    {
        // Add our bonus headers to the request
        {
            auto headers = request.Headers();
            for (auto [name, value] : m_extraHeaders) {
                headers.Insert(name, value);
            }
        }

        // And then use default handling for the rest.
        return m_base.SendRequestAsync(request);
    }
};

// Consumer
auto filter = ExtraHeadersHttpFilter();
filter.AddHeader(L"X-Contoso", L"Awesome");
auto client = HttpClient(filter);
⟦ Use the client ⟧
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that people like to do is stack filters on top of each other. Maybe you want to use the &lt;code&gt;Extra­Headers­Http­Filter&lt;/code&gt; in conjunction with a &lt;code&gt;Custom­Retry­Http­Filter&lt;/code&gt;. Right now, the &lt;code&gt;Extra­Headers­Http­Filter&lt;/code&gt; hands all of its requests to the default &lt;code&gt;Http­Base­Protocol­Filter&lt;/code&gt;, so there&amp;#8217;s no way to combine it with a &lt;code&gt;Custom­Retry­Http­Filter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to fix this is to give the &lt;code&gt;Extra­Headers­Http­Filter&lt;/code&gt; a constructor that takes another filter. Requests then pass through that custom filter instead of going to the default filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;// IDL
runtimeclass ExtraHeadersHttpFilter : Windows.Web.Http.Filters.IHttpFilter
{
    ExtraHeadersHttpFilter();
    &lt;span&gt;ExtraHeadersHttpFilter(Windows.Web.Http.Filters.IHttpFilter baseFilter);&lt;/span&gt;
    void AddHeader(string name, string value);
}

// Implementation

struct ExtraHeadersHttpFilter : ExtraHeadersHttpFilterT&amp;lt;ExtraHeadersHttpFilter&amp;gt;
{
    using namespace Http = winrt::Windows::Web::Http;
private:
    // Data members
    std::mutex m_mutex;
    std::unordered_map&amp;lt;winrt::hstring, winrt::hstring&amp;gt; m_extraHeaders;
    Http:Filters::&lt;span&gt;IHttpFilter&lt;/span&gt; m_base = Http:Filters::HttpBaseProtocolFilter();

public:
    ExtraHeadersHttpFilter() = default;

    &lt;span style="border-bottom: none;"&gt;ExtraHeadersHttpFilter(Http::Filters::IHttpFilter const&amp;amp; baseFilter) :&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="border-top: none;"&gt;    m_base(baseFilter) {}                                             &lt;/span&gt;

    // Bonus methods for public consumption
    void AddHeader(winrt::hstring const&amp;amp; name,
                   winrt::hstring const&amp;amp; value)
    {
        auto lock = std::lock_guard(m_mutex);
        m_extraHeaders.insert_or_assign(name, value);
    }

    // IHttpFilter methods
    winrt::Windows::Foundation::IAsyncOperationWithProgress&amp;lt;Http::HttpResponseMessage,
        Http::HttpProgress&amp;gt; SendRequestAsync(Http::HttpRequestMessage request)
    {
        // Add our bonus headers to the request
        {
            auto headers = request.Headers();
            for (auto [name, value] : m_extraHeaders) {
                headers.Insert(name, value);
            }
        }

        &lt;span&gt;// And then pass the request to the base filter.&lt;/span&gt;
        return m_base.SendRequestAsync(request);
    }
};

// Consumer
auto retryFilter = CustomRetryHttpFilter(3);
auto headerFilter = ExtraHeadersHttpFilter(retryFilter);
headerFilter.AddHeader(L"X-Contoso", L"Awesome");
auto client = HttpClient(headerFilter);
⟦ Use the client ⟧
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind HTTP filters is that each request passes through the filters before hitting the wire, and then the response passes through the filters on the way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;App&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filter1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Filter2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;FilterN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Network&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="border-bottom: none; text-align: center;"&gt;Request&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;→&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-bottom: none; text-align: center;"&gt;•&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;→&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-bottom: none; text-align: center;"&gt;•&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;→&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;→&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-bottom: none; text-align: center;"&gt;•&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;→&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-bottom: none; text-align: center;"&gt;↴&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="border-style: none solid;"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-style: none solid;"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-style: none solid; text-align: center;"&gt;↑&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-style: none solid;"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-style: none solid; text-align: center;"&gt;•&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="border-top: none; text-align: center;"&gt;•&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;←&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-top: none; text-align: center;"&gt;•&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;←&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-top: none; text-align: center;"&gt;•&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;←&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;←&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-top: none; text-align: center;"&gt;•&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;←&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="border-top: none; text-align: center;"&gt;Response&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above diagram, Filter2 is a Retry filter, so when it gets a response, it might decide to generate a new request and submit that one down the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, each filter can treat the remainder of the pipeline as a black box which conceptually submits the request and produces a result. Your filter doesn&amp;#8217;t even have to submit the request down the pipeline; maybe it sees something wrong with the request and chooses to generate an error response without actually hitting the wire. Or it might submit the request to two downstream pipelines for some reason. Or you may have a custom filter for testing purposes that replays prerecorded Web responses without every submitting them to the network at all. Each filter can decide whatever it likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus chatter&lt;/b&gt;: For expository purposes, I didn&amp;#8217;t show how to modify the result. You can find an example of that in the HttpClient sample&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/blob/ad9a0c4def222aaf044e51f8ee0939911cb58471/Samples/HttpClient/cppwinrt/PlugInFilter.cpp#L32"&gt; PluginFilter&lt;/a&gt; filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231117-00/?p=109028"&gt;The theory behind the IHttpFilter interface&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing"&gt;The Old New Thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quick link: When it comes to causal knowledge, every little bit (of lowered entropy) helps</title>
      <link>https://blog.rinesi.com/2023/11/quick-link-when-it-comes-to-causal-knowledge-every-little-bit-of-lowered-entropy-helps/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The paper:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a492b/"&gt;Not Causal or Descriptive But Some Secret, Other Thing: Entropy as a Criterion for Causal Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it says:&lt;/b&gt; The paper offers the view that the difference between causal and descriptive studies, and between different concepts of causal modeling, isn&amp;#8217;t a binary but a continuum, and that studying changes in the entropy of causal models can be a good way to map where you are and where you might need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My take:&lt;/b&gt; He&amp;#8217;s not wrong. I&amp;#8217;d qualify his analysis with the observation that sometimes we care about the entropy of certain subsets of the causal model: there are variables we are very much okay with knowing very little about if what we know is enough to infer what we need to know (although that always suggests there are possibly interesting structures hidden there). And of course you always want to graph the posteriors and look at them; entropy is a good constraint but it doesn&amp;#8217;t tell you the whole story. But, generally speaking, it&amp;#8217;s a good thing to keep an eye on, especially to quantify localized changes to your model after some experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why you should care in the big picture of things:&lt;/b&gt; The technical approach is useful, but it&amp;#8217;s mostly worth reading for the larger point that the goal of modeling is to &lt;i&gt;build knowledge&lt;/i&gt;, and that there aren&amp;#8217;t magical pipelines where you just throw in data on one end and get understanding out of the other (never mind &lt;i&gt;text&lt;/i&gt;; half of the scientific revolution was based on the observation that human language is a very awkward way to describe or think about big parts of the world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building knowledge is a hard, careful, annoying struggle, and you can and should use every trick and resource you have, from abstract thought experiments to raw observations to careful experiments, to move forward an inch. What makes it work isn&amp;#8217;t snobbery in your inputs but carefulness in your process: use everything and trust nothing, least of all yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical modeling methods, both conceptual and computational, are one of the best tools we have to do this sort of integration and make use of what we find. One of my main bets for the future &amp;mdash; or rather one of my main suggestions for competitive advantage whether you&amp;#8217;re competing against others or just against the stubborn limits of our minds &amp;mdash; is a wide collective shift from good databases and ersatz analysis as the default mode of organizational knowledge building and usage to good databases &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; good analysis. The current spike of interest in LLM-based AI is, I think, strategically correct if operationally askew; the tools are wrong but the desire is now there (sort of), and sometimes the desire is the difficult part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://blog.rinesi.com/2023/11/quick-link-when-it-comes-to-causal-knowledge-every-little-bit-of-lowered-entropy-helps/"&gt;Quick link: When it comes to causal knowledge, every little bit (of lowered entropy) helps&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://blog.rinesi.com"&gt;blog.rinesi.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
